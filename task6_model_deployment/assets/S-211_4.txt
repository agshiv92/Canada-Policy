CHAPTER 9
An Act to enact the Fighting Against Forced Labour
and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act and to amend
the Customs Tariff
[Assented to 11th May, 2023]
Preamble
Whereas forced labour and child labour are forms
of modern slavery;
Whereas Canada, as a party to the eight fundamental
conventions of the International Labour Organization
on fundamental labour rights — including the Forced
Labour Convention, 1930, adopted in Geneva on
June 28, 1930; the Abolition of Forced Labour Con-
vention, 1957, adopted in Geneva on June 25, 1957;
and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention,
1999, adopted at Geneva on June 17, 1999 — is de-
termined to contribute to the fight against modern
slavery;
And whereas Parliament considers that it is essential
to contribute to fighting modern slavery, including by
imposing reporting obligations on government insti-
tutions involved in producing, purchasing or dis-
tributing goods in Canada or elsewhere and on enti-
ties involved in manufacturing, producing, growing,
extracting or processing goods in Canada or else-
where or in importing goods manufactured, pro-
duced, grown, extracted or processed outside
Canada;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
