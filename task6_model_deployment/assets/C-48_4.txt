ASSENTED TO
DECEMBER 5, 2023
BILL C-48

Page 2 
SUMMARY
This enactment amends the Criminal Code to, among other
things,
(a) create a reverse onus provision for any person charged
with a serious offence involving violence and the use of a
weapon who has been convicted, within the last five years, of
a serious offence involving violence and the use of a weapon;
(b) add certain firearms offences to the existing reverse onus
provisions;
(c) expand the reverse onus provision for offences involving
intimate partner violence to ensure that it applies to an ac-
cused person who has been previously discharged for such
an offence;
(d) require the court to consider if an accused person has any
previous convictions involving violence and to include in the
record a statement that the safety and security of the commu-
nity was considered; and
(e) require the court to include in the record a statement set-
ting out how the court determined whether the accused is
Aboriginal or belongs to a vulnerable population and, if so,
how the particular circumstances of the accused were consid-
ered.
This enactment also makes further clarifications and provides for
a parliamentary review of the provisions it enacts or amends to
commence on the fifth anniversary of the day on which it re-
ceives royal assent, or as soon as feasible after that anniversary.

CHAPTER 30
An Act to amend the Criminal Code (bail reform)
[Assented to 5th December, 2023]
Preamble
Whereas Canada’s criminal justice system con-
tributes to a safe, peaceful and prosperous society
and the bail system plays a critical role in achieving
this objective;
Whereas the criminal justice system, including the
bail system, is a shared responsibility between the
federal, provincial and territorial governments;
Whereas repeated acts of violence, serious offences
committed with firearms or other weapons and ran-
dom acts of violence all have a harmful impact on
victims and communities and undermine public safe-
ty and confidence in the criminal justice system;
Whereas a proper functioning bail system is neces-
sary to maintain confidence in the criminal justice
system, including in the administration of justice;
Whereas a proper functioning bail system respects
and upholds the rights guaranteed by the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including the pre-
sumption of innocence, the right to liberty and the
right not to be denied reasonable bail without just
cause;
Whereas detention is justified when it is necessary
according to the grounds for detention set out in the
Criminal Code, including for the protection of public
safety and to maintain confidence in the administra-
tion of justice;
Whereas bail decisions are informed by other impor-
tant considerations, such as the need to consider the
particular circumstances of accused persons, includ-
ing those from populations that face disadvantages
at the bail stage and are overrepresented in the crimi-
nal justice system;
And whereas confidence in the administration of jus-
tice is eroded in cases when accused persons are re-
leased on bail while their detention is justified,
