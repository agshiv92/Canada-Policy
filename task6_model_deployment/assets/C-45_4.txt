RECOMMENDATION
Her Excellency the Governor General recommends to the House
of Commons the appropriation of public revenue under the cir-
cumstances, in the manner and for the purposes set out in a
measure entitled “An Act to amend the First Nations Fiscal Man-
agement Act, to make consequential amendments to other Acts,
and to make a clarification relating to another Act”.
SUMMARY
This enactment amends the First Nations Fiscal Management Act
to expand and modernize the mandates of the First Nations Tax
Commission and the First Nations Financial Management Board
in order to better reflect their current and future activities.
The enactment also establishes a First Nations Infrastructure In-
stitute that will provide First Nations and other interested Indige-
nous groups and organizations with tools and support, including
with respect to best practices, to implement and manage their
infrastructure. It also provides First Nations named in the sched-
ule to the First Nations Fiscal Management Act with the power to
make laws to regulate services provided by or on behalf of the
First Nations.
The enactment also aims to improve the functioning of that Act,
including by integrating the content of the Financing Secured by
Other Revenues Regulations, by combining into a single fund
the debt reserve fund for financing secured by property tax rev-
enues and the debt reserve fund for financing secured by other
revenues and by simplifying the way certain Indigenous groups
participate in pooled-borrowing.
Finally, the enactment makes consequential amendments to the
Access to Information Act and to the Privacy Act and includes a
clarification that addresses a transitional administrative over-
sight that followed the establishment in 2019 of the Department
of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs and the De-
partment of Indigenous Services.

agement Act is replaced by the following:
An Act to provide for powers of First Nations respect-
ing taxation, financial administration and the provi-
sion of services on reserve lands, to facilitate First
Nations’ access to financing secured by local rev-
enues or other revenues, to establish a First Nations

quential amendments to other Acts

Preamble
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to
responding to, to the extent of its authority, Call to
Action 44 in the Final Report of the Truth and Recon-
ciliation Commission of Canada and implementing
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of In-
digenous Peoples, including Articles 3 to 5, 20, 21
and 23 as they relate to the pursuit of economic

growth in Indigenous communities and to economic
reconciliation;
Whereas early contact Indigenous peoples had inno-
vative economic and trade systems supported by
public infrastructure, tax systems, sharing practices
and the development of trading languages to enable
commerce across linguistically diverse regions;
Whereas Indigenous languages have words for taxes
and sharing, including the word “taksis” in the Chi-
nook trading language;
Whereas the Government of Canada has adopted a
policy recognizing the inherent right of self-
government as an Aboriginal right and providing for
the negotiation of self-government;
Whereas this Act is not intended to define the nature
and scope of any right of self-government or to pre-
judge the outcome of any self-government negotia-
tion;
Whereas First Nations governments led an initiative
in 1988 to amend the Indian Act in order to recognize
their jurisdiction over real property taxation;
Whereas First Nations leaders led an initiative that re-
sulted in the development of legislation that would
enable First Nations to better exercise their jurisdic-
tion with respect to taxation, financial administration
and the provision of services on reserve lands and to
participate in pooled debenture borrowing;
Whereas economic development through the appli-
cation of local revenues and other revenues to sup-
port borrowing on capital markets for the develop-
ment of public infrastructure is available to other
governments in Canada;
Whereas local revenue systems on reserves should
recognize both the interests of on-reserve taxpayers
and the rights of members of First Nations communi-
ties;
And whereas First Nations and the Government of
Canada recognize the benefits of establishing Indige-
nous institutions as part of a comprehensive fiscal
framework;
