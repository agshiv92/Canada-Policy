BILL C-58

Page 2 
SUMMARY
This enactment amends the Canada Labour Code to, among oth-
er things,
(a) amend the scope of the prohibition relating to replace-
ment workers by removing the requirement of demonstrating
a purpose of undermining a trade union’s representational
capacity, by adding persons whose services must not be used
during legal strikes and lockouts and by providing certain ex-
ceptions;
(b) prohibit employers from using, during a legal strike or
lockout intended to involve the cessation of work by all em-
ployees in a bargaining unit, the services of an employee in
that unit, subject to certain exceptions;
(c) make the contravention by employers of either of those
prohibitions an offence punishable by a fine of up to $100,000
per day;
(d) authorize the Governor in Council to make regulations es-
tablishing an administrative monetary penalties scheme for
the purpose of promoting compliance with those prohibi-
tions; and
(e) amend the maintenance of activities process in order to,
among other things, encourage employers and trade unions
to reach an earlier agreement respecting activities to be
maintained in the event of a legal strike or lockout, encourage
faster decision making by the Canada Industrial Relations
Board when parties are unable to agree and reduce the need
for the Minister of Labour to make referrals to the Board.

of an employer was using the services of a person re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(b) and those services were the
same as or substantially similar to the duties of an em-
ployee in the bargaining unit, they may continue to use
those services throughout a strike or lockout not prohib-
ited by this Part involving that unit so long as they do so
in the same manner, to the same extent and in the same
circumstances as they did before the notice was given.
Prohibition relating to employees in bargaining unit
(6) Subject to subsection (7), during a strike or lockout
not prohibited by this Part that, with the exception of
work performed for the purpose of compliance with sec-
tion 87.4 or 87.7, is intended to involve the cessation of
work by all employees in the bargaining unit, no employ-
er or person acting on behalf of an employer shall use the

ployer who uses the services of any person referred to in
paragraphs (4)(a) to (d) or of an employee referred to in
subsection (6) does not contravene subsection (4) or (6) if
(a) the services are used solely in order to deal with a
situation that presents or could reasonably be expect-
ed to present an imminent or serious
(i) threat to the life, health or safety of any person,
(ii) threat of destruction of, or serious damage to,
the employer’s property or premises, or

(b) the use of the services is necessary in order to deal
with the situation because the employer or person act-
ing on behalf of an employer is unable to do so by any
other means, such as by using the services of a person
who is not referred to in paragraphs (4)(a) to (d) or in
subsection (6); and
(c) in the case of the services of a person referred to in
paragraphs (4)(a) to (d), the employer or person act-
ing on behalf of an employer gave the employees in
the bargaining unit on strike or locked out the oppor-
tunity to perform the necessary work before using the
services of that person.
For greater certainty
(8) For greater certainty, an employer or person acting
on behalf of an employer may rely on subsection (7) only
for the conservation purposes referred to in paragraph

services, operation of facilities or production of goods in
a manner contrary to subsection (4) or (6).
