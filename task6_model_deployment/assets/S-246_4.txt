[Assented to 20th June, 2023]
Preamble
Whereas Lebanese Canadians have, for generations,
made significant social, economic, cultural, religious,
military, philanthropic and political contributions to
our social fabric and to the strength, resiliency and
diversity of our communities;
Whereas Lebanese people around the world cele-
brate Lebanese Independence Day in commemora-
tion of their nation gaining independence on Novem-
ber 22, 1943;
Whereas Parliament wishes to recognize and cele-
brate the historic mark that Lebanese Canadians have
made and continue to make in building Canadian so-
ciety;
And whereas recognizing and celebrating Lebanese
Heritage Month across Canada would encourage
Lebanese Canadians to promote their traditions and
culture and share them with all Canadians;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
Short Title
Short title
