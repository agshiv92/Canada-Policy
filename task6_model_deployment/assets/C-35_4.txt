Guiding principles
7 (1) Federal investments respecting the establishment
and maintenance of a Canada-wide early learning and
child care system — as well as the efforts to enter into re-
lated agreements with the provinces and Indigenous peo-
ples — must be guided by the principles by which early
learning and child care programs and services should be
accessible, affordable, inclusive and of high quality and
must, therefore, aim to
(a) support the provision of, and facilitate equitable
access to, high-quality early learning and child care
programs and services — in particular those that are
provided by public and not for profit child care
providers — that meet standards set by provincial gov-
ernments or Indigenous governing bodies, that are
reﬂective of other evidence-based best practices in
high-quality service provision and that respond to the
varying needs of children and families;
(b) enable families of all income levels, including low
incomes, to beneﬁt from affordable early learning and
child care programs and services;
(c) support the provision, including in rural and re-
mote communities, of early learning and child care
programs and services that are inclusive of children
from systematically marginalized groups, including
children with disabilities, and of children from English
and French linguistic minority communities, that re-
spect and value the diversity of all children and fami-
lies and that respond to their varying needs; and
(d) support the provision of high-quality early learn-
ing and child care programs and services that foster
the social, emotional, physical and cognitive develop-
ment of young children, including through the recruit-
ment and retention of a qualiﬁed and well-supported
early childhood education workforce, recognizing that
working conditions aﬀect the provision of those pro-
grams and services.
