An Act to provide for the establishment of a national
council for reconciliation
[Assented to 30th April, 2024]
Preamble
Whereas, since time immemorial, First Nations and
Inuit peoples — and, post-contact, the Métis Nation
— have thrived on and managed and governed their
Indigenous lands;
Whereas, since the arrival of settlers and coloniza-
tion, Indigenous peoples have experienced assimila-
tionist policies, which must be addressed through
reconciliation;
Whereas reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is
recognized as a fundamental purpose of section 35 of
the Constitution Act, 1982;
Whereas that reconciliation requires collective efforts
from all peoples and the commitment of multiple
generations;
Whereas Indigenous peoples have their own collec-
tive identities, cultures, teachings and ways of life
and have, throughout history and to this day, contin-
ued to live in, use and occupy the lands that are now
in Canada;
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to
achieving reconciliation with Indigenous peoples
through renewed nation-to-nation, government-to-
government and Inuit-Crown relationships based on
recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and part-
nership;
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to
implementing the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples;
Whereas reconciliation requires the revitalization and
celebration of Indigenous languages;
Whereas the Government of Canada recognizes the
need for the establishment of an independent, non-
political, permanent and Indigenous-led organization
to monitor, evaluate, conduct research and report on
2021-2022-2023-2024

and promotion of the rights of Indigenous peoples, in
all sectors of Canadian society and by all govern-
ments in Canada, in order to address the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Call to Action
number 53;
Whereas the Government of Canada recognizes the
need for such an organization to be a catalyst for in-
novative thought, dialogue and action;
And whereas the Government of Canada recognizes
the importance of the work of such an organization
as well as the need to cooperate with it and support it
in its contribution to advancing reconciliation, includ-
ing through the provision of information referred to
in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of
Canada’s Call to Action number 55;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
