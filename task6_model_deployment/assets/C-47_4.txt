person that is an employer or a partnership is required to
file an information return in respect of a notifiable trans-
action under paragraph (4)(c) or (d), the filing of an in-
formation return required under those paragraphs by the
particular person in respect of the notifiable transaction
in prescribed form and manner is deemed to have been
made by each employee or partner of the particular per-
son in respect of the particular transaction.
Due diligence
(6) Paragraphs (4)(a) and (b) do not apply to a person in
respect of a notifiable transaction if the person has exer-
cised the degree of care, diligence and skill in determin-
ing whether the transaction is a notifiable transaction
that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised
in comparable circumstances.
Reasonable expectation to know
(7) Paragraphs (4)(c) and (d) do not apply to a person in
respect of a notifiable transaction unless the person
knows or should reasonably be expected to know that the

person in respect of each transaction that is part of a se-
ries of transactions that includes a notifiable transaction,

ports each transaction in the series is deemed to satisfy
the obligation of the person under subsection (4) in re-
spect of each transaction so reported.

ister may make any assessments, determinations and re-
determinations that are necessary to give effect to sub-

Penalty – non-application
(14) For greater certainty, if any person is deemed to
have filed an information return in prescribed form and
manner in respect of a particular notifiable transaction

under subsection (12) in respect of the particular transac-
tion.

rying value of the assets of a corporation is to be deter-
mined in accordance with paragraphs 181(3)(a) and (b).

tion by a person in respect of a notifiable transaction is
not an admission by the person that any transaction is
part of a series of transactions.

(17) Without restricting the generality of sections 231 to
231.3, even if a return of income has not been filed by a
taxpayer under section 150 for a taxation year of the tax-
payer in which a transaction occurs that is relevant to the
tax benefit referred to in paragraph (4)(a) that results (or
is expected to result) from a notifiable transaction, sec-
tions 231 to 231.3 apply, with such modifications as the
circumstances require, for the purpose of permitting the

rant:

ting out the address of the court from which a copy

Notice
(6) Before issuing a warrant under this section in rela-
tion to any property, a judge may require notice to be giv-
en to and may hear any person who, in the opinion of the
judge, appears to have a valid interest in the property un-
less the judge is of the opinion that giving such notice be-
fore the issuance of the warrant would result in the dis-

erty or otherwise affect the property so that all or a part
of it could not be seized under the warrant.

Article 7
1 The exemption from taxation accorded under Article X of
the Agreement to members of a force or civilian component in
respect of their salaries and emoluments shall apply, as re-
gards personnel of an Allied Headquarters within the defini-
tions in paragraph 1 (a) and (b) (i) of Article 3 of this Proto-
col, to salaries and emoluments paid to them as such person-
nel by the armed service to which they belong or by which
they are employed, except that this paragraph shall not ex-
empt any such member or employee from taxation imposed
by a State of which he is a national.
2 Employees of an Allied Headquarters of categories agreed
by the North Atlantic Council shall be exempted from taxa-
tion on the salaries and emoluments paid to them by the Al-
lied Headquarters in their capacity as such employees. Any
Party to the present Protocol may, however, conclude an ar-
rangement with the Allied Headquarters whereby such Party
will employ and assign to the Allied Headquarters all of its
nationals (except, if such Party so desires, any not ordinarily
resident within its territory) who are to serve on the staff of
the Allied Headquarters and pay the salaries and emoluments
of such persons from its own funds, at a scale fixes by it. The
salaries and emoluments so paid may be taxed by the Party
concerned but shall be exempted from taxation by any other
Party. If such an arrangement is entered into by any Party to
the present Protocol and is subsequently modified or termi-
nated, Parties to the present Protocol shall no longer be
bound under the first sentence of this paragraph to exempt
from taxation the salaries and emoluments paid to their na-
tionals.
Article 8
1 For the purpose of facilitating the establishment, construc-
tion, maintenance and operation of Allied Headquarters,
these Headquarters shall be relieved, so far as practicable,
from duties and taxes, affecting expenditures by them in the
interest of common defence and for their official and exclu-
sive benefit, and each Party to the present Protocol shall enter
into negotiations with any Allied Headquarters operating in
its territory for the purpose of concluding an agreement to
give effect to this provision.
2 An Allied Headquarters shall have the rights granted to a
force under Article XI of the Agreement subject to the same
conditions.
3 The provisions in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article XI of the
Agreement shall not apply to nationals of the receiving States,
unless such nationals belong to the armed services of a Party
to this Protocol other than the receiving State.
4 The expression ‘duties and taxes’ in this Article does not
include charges for services rendered.

Allied Headquarters under its capital budget and no longer
required by the Headquarters shall be disposed of under
arrangements approved by the North Atlantic Council and
the proceeds shall be distributed among or credited to the
Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty in the proportions in

loss in the value of the property provided by the receiving
State resulting from its use by the Headquarters shall be

sideration any applicable law of the receiving State) and

Article 10
Each Supreme Headquarters shall possess juridical personali-

rangements between it and the Supreme Headquarters or any
subordinate Allied Headquarters acting on behalf of the
Supreme Headquarters.
Article 11
1 Subject to the provisions of Article VIII of the Agreement, a
Supreme Headquarters may engage in legal proceedings as
claimant or defendant. However, the receiving State and the
Supreme Headquarters or any subordinate Allied Headquar-
ters authorized by it may agree that the receiving State shall
act on behalf of the Supreme Headquarters in any legal pro-
ceedings to which that Headquarters is a party before the
courts of the receiving State.
2 No measure of execution or measure directed to the seizure
or attachment of its property or funds shall be taken against
any Allied Headquarters, except for the purposes of para-

of any Allied Headquarters.
Article 13
The archives and other official documents of an Allied Head-

suant to the North Atlantic Treaty.
2 When the European Defence Community comes into being,
the present Protocol may be applied to the personnel of the
European Defence Forces attached to an Allied Headquarters
and their dependents at such time and in such manner as may
be determined by the North Atlantic Council.
Article 15
All differences between the Parties to the present Protocol or
between any such Parties and any Allied Headquarters relat-
ing to the interpretation or application of the Protocol shall
be settled by negotiation between the parties in dispute with-
out recourse to any outside jurisdiction. Except where express
provision is made to the contrary in the present Protocol or in
the Agreement, differences which cannot be settled by direct
negotiation shall be referred to the North Atlantic Council.
Article 16
1 Articles XV and XVII to XX of the Agreement shall apply as
regards the present Protocol as if they were an integral part
thereof, but so that the Protocol may be reviewed, suspended,
ratified, acceded to, denounced or extended in accordance
with those provisions independently from the Agreement.
2 The present Protocol may be supplemented by bilateral
agreement between the receiving State and a Supreme Head-
quarters, and the authorities of a receiving State and a
Supreme Headquarters may agree to give effect, by adminis-
trative means in advance of ratification, to any provisions of
this Protocol or of the Agreement as applied by it.
In witness whereof the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have
signed the present Protocol.
