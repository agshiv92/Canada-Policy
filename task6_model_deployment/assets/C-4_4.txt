CHAPTER 24
An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conversion ther-
apy)
[Assented to 8th December, 2021]
Preamble
Whereas conversion therapy causes harm to the per-
sons who are subjected to it;
Whereas conversion therapy causes harm to society
because, among other things, it is based on and
propagates myths and stereotypes about sexual ori-
entation, gender identity and gender expression, in-
cluding the myth that heterosexuality, cisgender gen-
der identity, and gender expression that conforms to
the sex assigned to a person at birth are to be pre-
ferred over other sexual orientations, gender identi-
ties and gender expressions;
And whereas, in light of those harms, it is important
to discourage and denounce the provision of conver-
sion therapy in order to protect the human dignity
and equality of all Canadians;
Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
R.S., c. C-46
Criminal Code
1 (1) Subsection 164(1) of the Criminal Code is
amended by striking out “or” at the end of para-
graph (d), by adding “or” at the end of paragraph
(e) and by adding the following after paragraph
(e):
(f) the representation, written material or recording,
copies of which are kept in premises within the juris-
diction of the court, is an advertisement for conver-
sion therapy.

Conversion Therapy
Definition of conversion therapy
320.101 In sections 320.102 to 320.104, conversion
therapy means a practice, treatment or service designed
to
(a) change a person’s sexual orientation to heterosex-
ual;
(b) change a person’s gender identity to cisgender;
2021
Chapter 24: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conversion therapy)
Criminal Code
Sections 2-5

Page 7 
(c) change a person’s gender expression so that it con-
forms to the sex assigned to the person at birth;
(d) repress or reduce non-heterosexual attraction or
sexual behaviour;
(e) repress a person’s non-cisgender gender identity;
or
(f) repress or reduce a person’s gender expression that
does not conform to the sex assigned to the person at
birth.
For greater certainty, this definition does not include a
practice, treatment or service that relates to the explo-
ration or development of an integrated personal identity
— such as a practice, treatment or service that relates to a
person’s gender transition — and that is not based on an
assumption that a particular sexual orientation, gender
identity or gender expression is to be preferred over an-
other.
Conversion therapy
320.102 Everyone who knowingly causes another per-
son to undergo conversion therapy — including by pro-
viding conversion therapy to that other person — is
(a) guilty of an indictable offence and liable to impris-
onment for a term of not more than five years; or
(b) guilty of an offence punishable on summary con-
viction.
Promoting or advertising
320.103 Everyone who knowingly promotes or advertis-
es conversion therapy is
(a) guilty of an indictable offence and liable to impris-
onment for a term of not more than two years; or
(b) guilty of an offence punishable on summary con-
viction.
Material benefit
320.104 Everyone who receives a financial or other ma-
terial benefit, knowing that it is obtained or derived di-
rectly or indirectly from the provision of conversion ther-
apy, is
(a) guilty of an indictable offence and liable to impris-
onment for a term of not more than two years; or
(b) guilty of an offence punishable on summary con-
viction.
