Offender Information Registration Act and
the International Transfer of Offenders Act
ASSENTED TO
OCTOBER 26, 2023
BILL S-12

Page 2 
SUMMARY
This enactment amends the Criminal Code, the Sex Offender In-
formation Registration Act and the International Transfer of Of-
fenders Act to, among other things,
(a) require compliance with the Sex Offender Information
Registration Act for persons who are convicted of an offence
of a sexual nature against a child and for persons who have
been convicted on separate occasions of two or more of-
fences of a sexual nature;
(b) require other persons who are convicted of, or receive a
verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental
disorder for, an offence of a sexual nature to comply with that
Act unless a court is satisfied that doing so would have no
connection to the purposes of that Act or that the impact on
the person of doing so would be grossly disproportionate to
those purposes;
(c) provide that an order to comply with that Act as a result
of convictions, or verdicts of not criminally responsible on ac-
count of mental disorder, for two or more offences of a sexu-
al nature that are dealt with in the same proceeding — or an
obligation to comply with that Act as a result of convictions,
or such verdicts, for two or more offences of a sexual nature
— does not apply for life if a court is satisfied that the of-
fences do not demonstrate a pattern of behaviour showing
that the person presents an increased risk of reoffending by
committing such an offence;
(d) authorize a peace officer to obtain a warrant to arrest a
person who has contravened any of sections 4 to 5.1 of that
Act and bring them to a registration centre to remedy that
contravention; and
(e) clarify the obligations in section 6 of that Act respecting
the notice that sex offenders who plan to absent themselves
from their residence must provide.
The enactment also amends the Criminal Code to, among other
things, codify the process for modifying and revoking publica-
tion bans, and add a requirement for sentencing courts to in-
quire into whether the victim of an offence would like to receive
information about the administration of the offender’s sentence
and, in the affirmative, provide the Correctional Service of
Canada with the victim’s contact information.

ter section 486.5:

made the order or, if that court is for any reason unable
to act, another court of equivalent jurisdiction in the
same province shall, without holding a hearing, vary or

(a) the designated offence was prosecuted by indict-
ment;
(b) the sentence for the designated offence is a term of
imprisonment of two years or more; and
(c) the victim of the designated offence is under the
age of 18 years.
Order — previous offence or obligation
(2) Subject to subsection (5), when a court imposes a
sentence on a person for a designated offence, it shall
make an order in Form 52 requiring the person to comply
with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act if
the prosecutor establishes that, before or after the com-
ing into force of paragraphs (a) and (b), the person
(a) was previously convicted of a primary offence or
previously convicted under section 130 of the National
Defence Act in respect of a primary offence; or
(b) is or was, as a result of a conviction, subject to an
order or obligation under this or another Act of Parlia-

sentence on a person for a designated offence in circum-
stances in which neither subsection (1) nor (2) applies, or

sponsible on account of mental disorder for a designated
offence, it shall make an order in Form 52 requiring the
person to comply with the Sex Offender Information
Registration Act unless the court is satisfied the person
has established that
(a) there would be no connection between making the
order and the purpose of helping police services pre-
vent or investigate crimes of a sexual nature by requir-
ing the registration of information relating to sex of-
fenders under that Act; or
(b) the impact of the order on the person, including
on their privacy or liberty, would be grossly dispropor-
tionate to the public interest in protecting society
through the effective prevention or investigation of
crimes of a sexual nature, to be achieved by the regis-
tration of information relating to sex offenders under
that Act.

fence.

be made; and
(b) the court is satisfied that those offences demon-
strate, or form part of, a pattern of behaviour showing
that the person presents an increased risk of reoffend-
ing by committing a crime of a sexual nature.

(4) If paragraph (3)(a) applies in the circumstances but
