measure entitled “An Act to implement certain provisions of the
fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21,
2023 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament
on March 28, 2023”.
SUMMARY
Part 1 implements certain measures in respect of the Income Tax
Act and the Income Tax Regulations by
(a) limiting the deductibility of net interest and financing ex-
penses by certain corporations and trusts, consistent with
certain Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment and the Group of Twenty Base Erosion and Profit Shift-
ing project recommendations;
(b) implementing hybrid mismatch rules consistent with the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
and the Group of Twenty Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
project recommendations regarding cross-border tax avoid-
ance structures that exploit differences in the income tax laws
of two or more countries to produce “deduction/non-inclu-
sion mismatches”;
(c) allowing expenditures incurred in the exploration and de-
velopment of all lithium to qualify as Canadian exploration
expenses and Canadian development expenses;
(d) ensuring that only genuine intergenerational business
transfers are excluded from the anti-surplus stripping rule in

ceived by Canadian financial institutions on certain shares

tion Incentive payments (CAIP) from 10% to 20% for the 2023
and subsequent taxation years as well as referencing the
2016 census data for the purposes of the CAIP rural supple-
ment eligibility for the 2023 and 2024 taxation years;
(g) providing a refundable investment tax credit to qualifying
businesses for eligible carbon capture, utilization and storage
equipment;
(h) providing a refundable investment tax credit to qualifying
businesses for eligible clean technology equipment;

more than 10% of their revenue from sources other than cer-
tain specified sources;

Plan following the death of that plan’s last remaining holder
who was also a qualifying family member;
(l) implementing consequential changes of a technical nature
to facilitate the operation of the existing rules for First Home
Savings Accounts;
(m) introducing a tax of 2% on the net value of equity repur-
chases by certain Canadian corporations, trusts and partner-
ships whose equity is listed on a designated stock exchange;
(n) exempting certain fees from the refundable tax applicable
to contributions under retirement compensation arrange-
ments;
(o) introducing a technical amendment to the provision that
authorizes the sharing of taxpayer information for the pur-
poses of the Canadian Dental Care Plan;
(p) implementing a number of amendments to the general
anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) as well as introducing a new
penalty applicable to transactions subject to the GAAR and
extending the normal reassessment period for the GAAR by
three years in certain circumstances;
(q) facilitating the creation of employee ownership trusts;
(r) introducing specific anti-avoidance rules in relation to cor-
porations referred to as substantive CCPCs; and

the eligible activities, in relation to the reduced tax rates for
certain zero-emission technology manufacturers.
It also makes related and consequential amendments to the Ex-
cise Tax Act and the Excise Act, 2001.
Part 2 enacts the Digital Services Tax Act and its regulations.
That Act provides for the implementation of an annual tax of 3%
on certain types of digital services revenue earned by businesses
that meet certain revenue thresholds. It sets out rules for the
purposes of establishing liability for the tax and also sets out ap-
plicable reporting and filing requirements. To promote compli-
ance with its provisions, that Act includes modern administra-
tion and enforcement provisions generally aligned with those
found in other taxation statutes. Finally, this Part also makes re-
lated and consequential amendments to other texts to ensure
proper implementation of the tax and cohesive and efficient ad-
ministration by the Canada Revenue Agency.
Part 3 implements certain Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized
Sales Tax (GST/HST) measures by

quired to file an information return for a calendar year
under subsection (6), the taxpayer is deemed to have
filed the information return if
(a) an information return under subsection (6) is filed
for the calendar year by any other taxpayer (in this

spect of the taxpayer for the year) that is an eligible
group entity in respect of the taxpayer at the end of

ered, having regard to all the circumstances, that one of
the main purposes of the particular taxpayer being, be-
coming or ceasing to be an eligible group entity, in re-
spect of the other taxpayer, a financial institution group
entity or a financial holding corporation is to enable any
taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit (within the meaning of
subsection 245(1)), the particular taxpayer is deemed not

that time of the property.

the calculation is made in the first relevant taxation
year, each Canadian group member is deemed to have

Use of accounting terms
(6) For the purposes of the definitions consolidated fi-
nancial statements, consolidated group, equity-ac-
counted entity, fair value amount, group adjusted net
book income, specified interest expense, specified in-
terest income and ultimate parent in subsection (1), a

assigned to the term for financial reporting purposes un-
der the relevant acceptable accounting standards.
Single member group

group for the period if a portion of the amount of the
specified interest expense of the group is paid or payable
by a member of the group to the particular person or
partnership as part of a transaction or series of transac-
tions where it can reasonably be considered that one of
the main purposes of the transaction or series is to avoid
the inclusion of that portion in the determination of the
amount for E in the definition group net interest ex-
pense in subsection (1).

years of a taxpayer that begin on or after October
1, 2023, except that
(a) sections 18.2 and 18.21 of the Act, as enacted
by subsection (1), also apply in respect of a tax-
ation year of a taxpayer that begins before, and

preceding taxation years was, because of a
transaction or event or a series of transac-
tions or events, shorter than it would have
been in the absence of that transaction,
event or series, and
(ii) it can reasonably be considered that one
of the purposes of the transaction, event or

18.2 or 18.21 of the Act, as enacted by subsec-
tion (1), or the application of paragraph
12(1)(l.2) of the Act, as enacted by subsection

gins after 2022 but before 2024 is, because of a
transaction or event or a series of transac-
tions or events, shorter than it would have
been in the absence of that transaction,
event or series, and

of the purposes of the transaction, event or
series was to defer the application of para-
graph (b) of that definition to the taxpayer;

is a corporation or a fixed interest commercial
trust for a particular taxation year, the taxpay-

immediately preceding the first taxation year
of the taxpayer in respect of which subsection
(1) applies (in this paragraph and paragraph
(d) referred to as the “first regime year” of the
taxpayer) is deemed to be nil unless

scribed form to have paragraph (d) apply in
respect of the taxpayer,

with the Minister by the taxpayer or by an
eligible pre-regime group entity of the tax-
payer on or before the earliest filing-due

and any other taxation year in which the
taxpayer’s ratio of permissible expenses
is the same as in the particular year, one
or more portions of the group net excess
capacity (as defined in subparagraph
(d)(vi)) for the pre-regime years that is
determined for that purpose, and

determining the taxpayer’s cumulative unused
excess capacity for a particular taxation year
and any other taxation year in which the tax-

(i) the amount is included in the Canadian ordinary
income of any taxpayer under paragraph (b) or (c),
(ii) the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction under
section 112 or 113 in respect of the payment, or

Interpretation
(2) This section, section 12.7 and subsection 113(5), as
well as related provisions of the Act and the Income Tax
Regulations, relate to the implementation of Neutralis-
ing the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Ac-
tion 2 — 2015 Final Report published by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development and, unless
the context otherwise requires, are to be interpreted con-
sistently with that report, as amended from time to time.
Primary rule — conditions for application
(3) Subsection (4) applies in respect of a payment if
(a) in the absence of this section and subsection 18(4),
an amount would be deductible, in respect of the pay-
ment, in computing a taxpayer’s income from a busi-
ness or property for a taxation year; and
(b) that amount is the deduction component of a hy-
brid mismatch arrangement under which the payment
arises.
Primary rule — consequences
(4) If this subsection applies in respect of a payment,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, in com-
puting a taxpayer’s income from a business or property
for a taxation year, no deduction shall be made in respect
of the payment to the extent of the hybrid mismatch
amount in respect of the payment.
Structured arrangements — exception
(5) If subsection (4) or 12.7(3) would, in the absence of
this subsection, apply in respect of a payment in comput-
ing a taxpayer’s income from a business or property for a
taxation year, that subsection does not apply in respect of
the payment if
(a) there would be no hybrid mismatch arrangement
in respect of the payment if the payment did not arise
under, or in connection with, a structured arrange-
ment;
(b) at the time that the taxpayer entered into, or ac-
quired an interest in any part of a transaction that is,
or is part of, the structured arrangement, it was not
reasonable to expect that any of the following entities
were aware of the deduction/non-inclusion mismatch
arising from the payment:

(i) the taxpayer,
(ii) an entity with which the taxpayer does not deal
at arm’s length, or
(iii) a specified entity in respect of the taxpayer;
and
(c) none of the entities described in subparagraphs
(b)(i) to (iii) shared in the value of any economic bene-
fit resulting from the deduction/non-inclusion mis-
match.
Deduction/non-inclusion mismatch — conditions
(6) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, a
payment gives rise to a deduction/non-inclusion mis-
match if
(a) the following condition is met:
A > B
where
A
is the total of all amounts, each of which would, in
the absence of this section and subsection 18(4),
be deductible in respect of the payment, in com-
puting the income of a taxpayer from a business
or property under this Part for a taxation year (re-
ferred to in this paragraph as the “relevant year”),
and
B
is the total of all amounts each of which, in respect
of the payment,
(i) can reasonably be expected to be — and ac-
tually is — foreign ordinary income of an entity
for a foreign taxation year that begins on or be-
fore the day that is 12 months after the end of
the relevant year, or
(ii) is Canadian ordinary income of a taxpayer
for a taxation year that begins on or before the
day that is 12 months after the end of the rele-
vant year; or
(b) the following condition is met:
C > D
where
C
is the total of all amounts, each of which, in the
absence of any foreign expense restriction rule,
would be — or would reasonably be expected to be
— deductible, in respect of the payment, in com-
puting relevant foreign income or profits of an en-
tity for a foreign taxation year (referred to in this
paragraph as the “relevant foreign year”), and
D
is the total of all amounts, each of which, in re-
spect of the payment,

(i) would, in the absence of section 12.7, be
Canadian ordinary income of a taxpayer for a
taxation year that begins on or before the day
that is 12 months after the end of the relevant
foreign year, or
(ii) can reasonably be expected to be — and ac-
tually is — foreign ordinary income of another
entity for a foreign taxation year that begins on
or before the day that is 12 months after the
end of the relevant foreign year.
Deduction/non-inclusion mismatch — application
(7) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, if a
payment gives rise to a deduction/non-inclusion mis-
match,
(a) the amount, if any, determined for A in paragraph
(6)(a) in respect of the payment is the deduction com-
ponent of the deduction/non-inclusion mismatch;
(b) the amount, if any, determined for C in paragraph
(6)(b) in respect of the payment is the foreign deduc-
tion component of the deduction/non-inclusion mis-
match; and
(c) the amount of the deduction/non-inclusion mis-
match arising from the payment is determined by the
formula
A − B
where
A
is
(i) if paragraph (6)(a) applies in respect of the
payment, the deduction component of the de-
duction/non-inclusion mismatch, or
(ii) if paragraph (6)(b) applies in respect of the
payment, the foreign deduction component of
the deduction/non-inclusion mismatch, and
B
is
(i) if subparagraph (i) of the description of A
applies,
(A) where the amount determined for B in
paragraph (6)(a) in respect of the payment is
equal to 10% or less of the amount deter-
mined for A, nil, and

(B) in any other case, the amount deter-
mined for B in paragraph (6)(a) in respect of
the payment, or
(ii) if subparagraph (ii) of the description of A
applies,
(A) where the amount determined for D in
paragraph (6)(b) in respect of the payment is
equal to 10% or less of the amount deter-
mined for A, nil, and
(B) in any other case, the amount deter-
mined for D in paragraph (6)(b) in respect of
the payment.
No double counting
(8) Any amount that has already been included, directly
or indirectly, in computing foreign ordinary income or
Canadian ordinary income of a particular entity in re-
spect of a payment shall not be included, directly or indi-
rectly, in computing foreign ordinary income or Canadi-
an ordinary income of the particular entity or any other
entity in respect of the payment.
Notional interest expense — deemed payment
(9) For the purposes of this section (other than this sub-
section) and section 12.7, if, in the absence of any foreign
expense restriction rule, an amount (referred to in this
subsection as the “deductible amount”) would be, or can
reasonably be expected to be, deductible in respect of a
notional interest expense on a debt in computing the rel-
evant foreign income or profits of an entity for a foreign
taxation year
(a) the entity is deemed to make a payment in the year
under the debt to the creditor in respect of the debt, in
an amount equal to the deductible amount, and the
creditor is deemed to be a recipient of the payment;
(b) the deductible amount is deemed to be in respect
of the payment;
(c) any amount that is foreign ordinary income or
Canadian ordinary income of the creditor in respect of
notional interest income on the debt, that is calculated
in respect of the same time period as the notional in-
terest expense, is deemed to arise in respect of the
payment; and
(d) any deduction/non-inclusion mismatch arising
from the payment is deemed to satisfy the condition in
paragraph (10)(d).

Hybrid financial instrument arrangement —
conditions
(10) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, a
payment arises under a hybrid financial instrument ar-
rangement if
(a) the payment (other than a payment described in
paragraphs (14)(a) to (d)) arises under, or in connec-
tion with, a financial instrument;
(b) any of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) a payer of the payment does not deal at arm’s
length with, or is a specified entity in respect of, a
recipient of the payment, or
(ii) the payment arises under, or in connection
with, a structured arrangement;
(c) the payment gives rise to a deduction/non-inclu-
sion mismatch; and
(d) it can reasonably be considered that the deduc-
tion/non-inclusion mismatch
(i) arises in whole or in part because of a difference
in the treatment of the financial instrument — or of
one or more transactions, either alone or together,
where the transaction or transactions are part of a
transaction or series of transactions that includes
the payment or relates to the financial instrument
— for tax purposes under the laws of more than one
country that is attributable to the terms or condi-
tions of the financial instrument or transaction or
transactions, or
(ii) would arise in whole or in part because of a dif-
ference described in subparagraph (i), if any other
reason for the deduction/non-inclusion mismatch
were disregarded.
Hybrid financial instrument arrangement — amount
(11) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, if a
payment arises under a hybrid financial instrument ar-
rangement,
(a) the amount of the hybrid financial instrument
mismatch, in respect of the payment, is the portion of
the amount of the deduction/non-inclusion mismatch
arising from the payment that meets the condition in
subparagraph (10)(d)(i) or (ii);

(b) the deduction component, if any, of the deduc-
tion/non-inclusion mismatch is the deduction compo-
nent of the hybrid financial instrument arrangement
in respect of the payment; and
(c) the foreign deduction component, if any, of the de-
duction/non-inclusion mismatch is the foreign deduc-
tion component of the hybrid financial instrument ar-
rangement in respect of the payment.
Hybrid transfer arrangement — conditions
(12) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, a
payment (other than an exempt dealer compensation
payment) arises under a hybrid transfer arrangement if
(a) the payment arises under, or in connection with,
(i) a transaction or series of transactions (referred
to in this subsection as the “transfer arrangement”)
that includes a loan or a disposition or other trans-
fer by an entity to another entity (referred to in this
subsection as the “transferor” and “transferee”, re-
spectively) of all or a portion of a financial instru-
ment (referred to in this subsection as the “trans-
ferred instrument”), or
(ii) the transferred instrument;
(b) any of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) at any time during the transfer arrangement
(A) a payer of the payment does not deal at
arm’s length with, or is a specified entity in re-
spect of, a recipient of the payment, or
(B) the transferor does not deal at arm’s length
with, or is a specified entity in respect of, the
transferee, or
(ii) the payment arises under, or in connection
with, a structured arrangement;
(c) the payment gives rise to a deduction/non-inclu-
sion mismatch; and
(d) it can reasonably be considered that the deduc-
tion/non-inclusion mismatch arises (or would arise, if
any reason for the mismatch other than the reasons
described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) were disre-
garded), in whole or in part, because
(i) if the payment arises as compensation for a par-

(A) the tax laws of one country treat all or a por-
tion of the payment as though it has the same
character as, or represents, the particular pay-
ment, in determining the tax consequences to an
entity that is a recipient of the payment but not
of the particular payment, and
(B) the tax laws of another country treat all or a
portion of the payment as a deductible expense
of another entity, or
(ii) in any other case,
(A) the tax laws of one country treat one or more
transactions included in the transfer arrange-
ment, either alone or together, as or as equiva-
lent to a borrowing or other indebtedness, or
treat all or a portion of the payment as arising
under, or in connection with, a borrowing or
other indebtedness, and the tax laws of another
country do not treat the transaction or transac-
tions, or the payment, as the case may be, in that
manner, or
(B) the tax laws of one country treat the pay-
ment, or any other payment arising under, or in
connection with, the transfer arrangement or
transferred instrument, as though the payment
or other payment, as the case may be, was de-
rived by one entity and the tax laws of another
country treat the payment or other payment, as
the case may be, as though it was derived by an-
other entity, because of a difference in how the
countries treat one or more transactions includ-
ed in the transfer arrangement, either alone or
together.
Hybrid transfer arrangement — amount
(13) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, if a
payment arises under a hybrid transfer arrangement,
(a) the amount of the hybrid transfer mismatch, in re-
spect of the payment, is the portion of the amount of
the deduction/non-inclusion mismatch arising from
the payment that meets a condition in subparagraph
(12)(d)(i) or (ii);
(b) the deduction component, if any, of the deduc-
tion/non-inclusion mismatch is the deduction compo-
nent of the hybrid transfer arrangement in respect of
the payment; and

(c) the foreign deduction component, if any, of the de-
duction/non-inclusion mismatch is the foreign deduc-
tion component of the hybrid transfer arrangement in
respect of the payment.
Substitute payment arrangement — conditions
(14) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, a
payment arises under a substitute payment arrangement
if
(a) the payment arises under, or in connection with,
an arrangement under which all or a portion of a fi-
nancial instrument is loaned or disposed of or other-
wise transferred by an entity to another entity (re-
ferred to in this subsection as the “transferor” and
“transferee”, respectively);
(b) the transferee, or an entity that does not deal at
arm’s length with the transferee, is a payer of the pay-
ment;
(c) the transferor, or an entity that does not deal at
arm’s length with the transferor, is a recipient of the
payment;
(d) all or a portion of the payment can reasonably be
considered to represent or otherwise reflect, or be de-
termined by reference to
(i) another payment (referred to in this subsection
and subsection (15) as the “underlying return”) that
arises under, or in connection with, the financial in-
strument, or
(ii) revenue, profit, cash flow, commodity price or
any other similar criterion;
(e) any of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) at any time during that series of transactions
that includes the arrangement,
(A) a payer of the payment does not deal at
arm’s length with, or is a specified entity in re-
spect of, a recipient of the payment, or
(B) the transferor does not deal at arm’s length
with, or is a specified entity in respect of, the
transferee, or
(ii) the payment arises under, or in connection
with, a structured arrangement;

(i) would give rise to a deduction/non-inclusion
mismatch if any Canadian ordinary income of a tax-
payer for a taxation year and any foreign ordinary
income of an entity for a foreign taxation year, in
respect of the payment, were limited to the portion
of those amounts that can reasonably be considered
to relate to the portion of the payment that is de-
scribed in paragraph (d), or
(ii) if the condition in subparagraph (i) is not met,
would meet the condition in that subparagraph if
any amount that, in the absence of this section,
subsection 18(4) or any foreign expense restriction
rule, would be — or would reasonably be expected
to be — deductible by the transferee in respect of
the underlying return were instead considered to be
deductible in respect of the payment, to the extent
that the amount
(A) would be — or would reasonably be expected
to be — deductible by the transferee in comput-
ing its income from a business or property for a
taxation year or its relevant foreign income or
profits for a foreign taxation year, as the case
may be, and
(B) would be — or would reasonably be expected
to be — so deductible because the underlying re-
turn accrued (or is considered to accrue) for a
period before the transfer;
(g) one of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) the transferee or an entity that does not deal at
arm’s length with the transferee is a recipient of the
underlying return — or, if subparagraph (d)(ii) ap-
plies, a distribution under the financial instrument
— and the amount of the underlying return or the
distribution, as the case may be, exceeds the total of
all amounts, in respect of the underlying return or
the distribution, as the case may be, each of which
can reasonably be expected to be — and actually is
— foreign ordinary income for a foreign taxation
year or Canadian ordinary income for a taxation
year, as the case may be, of the recipient,
(ii) the condition in subparagraph (i) would be sat-
isfied if the transferee were the recipient of the un-
derlying return, or, if subparagraph (d)(ii) applies,
a distribution under the financial instrument, or

derlying return, or, if subparagraph (d)(ii) applies,

reasonably be expected to be foreign ordinary in-
come for a foreign taxation year or Canadian or-

may be, of the transferor,

case may be, would arise under a hybrid mis-
match arrangement, or

sonably be expected to apply in respect of the
underlying return or distribution, as the case
may be; and
(h) one of the following entities is not resident in
Canada:
(i) the transferor,
(ii) the transferee,
(iii) a recipient of the payment,
(iv) a payer of the payment,
(v) the issuer of the financial instrument,
(vi) a recipient of the underlying return, and
(vii) if an entity described in any of subparagraphs
(i) to (vi) is a partnership, a member of that entity.
Substitute payment arrangement — amount
(15) For the purposes of this section and section 12.7, if a
payment arises under a substitute payment arrangement,
(a) the amount of the substitute payment mismatch,
in respect of the payment, is the lesser of
(i) the amount of the deduction/non-inclusion mis-
match arising from the payment,
(A) if the condition in subparagraph (14)(f)(i)
applies, determined based on the assumption in
that subparagraph, or

(B) if the condition in subparagraph (14)(f)(ii)
applies, determined based on the assumption in
that subparagraph, and
(ii) the amount of the payment, or the portion of
the payment, as the case may be, described in para-
graph (14)(d);
(b) the deduction component, if any, of the deduc-
tion/non-inclusion mismatch is the deduction compo-
nent of the substitute payment arrangement in respect
of the payment;

duction/non-inclusion mismatch is the foreign deduc-
tion component of the substitute payment arrange-
ment in respect of the payment; and

in respect of the payment, any amount that, in the ab-
sence of this section, subsection 18(4) or any foreign
expense restriction rule, would be — or would reason-
ably be expected to be — deductible by the transferee
in respect of the underlying return that meets the con-
ditions in clauses (14)(f)(ii)(A) and (B) is deemed to be
deductible by the transferee in respect of the payment
for the purposes of applying subsections (3) and (4)

rights referred to in the portion of the definition
specified shareholder in subsection 18(5) after
paragraph (b) of that definition or in paragraph (a)
or (b) of the definition specified beneficiary in
that subsection, or that are similar rights in respect

that time and the references in that definition to
“particular person” are to be read as references to
“first entity”; and
(b) notwithstanding paragraph (a), a particular entity

(ii) there was in effect at that time an agreement or
arrangement under which, on the satisfaction of a
condition or the occurrence of an event that it is
reasonable to expect will be satisfied or will occur,
the particular entity will cease to be a specified enti-

(iii) the purpose for which the particular entity be-
came a specified entity was the safeguarding of
rights or interests of the particular entity or an enti-
ty with which the particular entity is not dealing at
arm’s length in respect of any indebtedness owing
at any time to the particular entity or an entity with
which the particular entity is not dealing at arm’s
length.

deduction/non-inclusion mismatch, arising from a pay-
ment if
(a) it can reasonably be considered that one of the
main purposes of a transaction or series of transac-

application of subsection (4), 12.7(3) or 113(5) in re-
spect of the payment; and
(b) any of the following conditions is met:

be — or would reasonably be expected to be — de-
ductible in respect of the payment in computing

or in part because of a difference in tax treatment of
any transaction or series of transactions under the
laws of more than one country that is attributable
to the terms or conditions of the transaction or one
or more transactions included in the series, or
(iii) the mismatch or other outcome would arise in
whole or in part because of a difference described
in subparagraph (ii), if any other reason for the
mismatch or other outcome were disregarded.

pense restriction rule, would be — or would reason-
ably be expected to be — deductible by the transfer-

is foreign ordinary income of an entity in respect of

nary income already taken into account in determin-
ing the amount of the deduction that was previously
denied or a deduction under this paragraph) for a for-
eign taxation year that ends on or before the day that

claimant on the preparation or installation of specified
property;

specifies a maximum ratio of apprentices to jour-
neypersons, or otherwise restricts the number of ap-
prentices employed at a designated work site, prevents

centive claimant makes reasonable efforts to ensure

ty, is performed by apprentices registered in a Red

that specified tax credit, there shall be added to the tax
payable under this Part for the installation taxation year
by the incentive claimant an amount equal to $20 for

covered worker was not paid the prevailing wage.
Addition to tax — apprenticeship requirement
(7) Unless subsection (9) applies, if an incentive claimant
claims a specified tax credit at a regular tax credit rate in
a taxation year in respect of a designated work site, but
less than 10% of the total hours that are worked during
an installation taxation year in respect of that specified
tax credit at the designated work site on the preparation
or installation of specified property are worked by ap-
prentices registered in a Red Seal trade, there shall be
added to the tax payable under this Part for the installa-
tion taxation year by the incentive claimant the amount
determined by the formula
$50 × (A − B)
where
A
is the total number of hours of labour required to be
performed by apprentices registered in a Red Seal
trade for the installation taxation year at the desig-
nated work site of the incentive claimant as de-
scribed in paragraph (5)(a) or (b), as applicable, in
each case read without reference to the words “the
incentive claimant makes reasonable efforts to en-
sure that”; and

failed to meet the prevailing wage requirements or the
apprenticeship requirements for an installation taxation
year in respect of that specified tax credit and the Minis-
ter determines that the incentive claimant knowingly or
in circumstances amounting to gross negligence failed to
meet those requirements, then
(a) the incentive claimant is not entitled to the regular
tax credit rate, and is entitled to not more than the re-
duced tax credit rate, for the specified tax credit; and
(b) the incentive claimant is liable to a penalty for the
claim year equal to the amount determined by the for-
mula
50% × (A − B)
where
A
is the amount of the specified tax credit claimed
by the incentive claimant at the regular tax credit
rate for the claim year, and

is the amount that the incentive claimant would
have been entitled to claim as a specified tax cred-
it at the reduced tax credit rate for the claim year.

Corrective measures — prevailing wage requirement

fying that the incentive claimant did not meet the pre-
vailing wage requirements for a designated work site for
a taxation year, the incentive claimant may within one
year after receipt of the notification, or such longer peri-
od as is acceptable to the Minister, cause each covered
worker to be paid the top-up amount determined under
subsection (12).
Top-up amount
(12) For each covered worker in respect of an incentive
claimant, the top-up amount referred to in subsection
(11) for a taxation year shall equal or exceed the amount
determined by the formula
A − B + C
where

is the amount that the covered worker would have
received or benefited from, in respect of the worker’s

employment at the designated work site during the
taxation year, had the covered worker been paid in
accordance with the prevailing wage requirements in
paragraph (3)(a) or subparagraph (3)(b)(i), as appli-
cable;
B
is the amount that the worker actually received or
benefited from, in respect of the worker’s employ-
ment at the designated work site during the taxation
year; and
C
is interest on the difference between the description
of A and the description of B, calculated from the be-
ginning of the taxation year to the time of payment at
the prescribed rate specified in paragraph 4301(a) of
the Income Tax Regulations.
Top-up payment not made
(13) For any covered worker in respect of whom a top-up
amount is not paid under subsection (11), the incentive
claimant shall pay to the Receiver General, as a penalty
under this Act, 120% of the amount determined by the
formula in subsection (12).
Tax treatment of top-up amount
(14) A top-up amount that is paid to a covered worker
(a) is deemed to be
(i) salary and wages of the worker for the year in
which it is received, and
(ii) deductible in computing income by the payor
for the year in which it is paid; and
(b) does not qualify for any specified tax credit.
Exception
(15) This section does not apply to a specified tax credit
claimed for the acquisition of off-road zero emission ve-
hicles or to the acquisition and installation of low carbon
heat equipment.
Deemed reasonable efforts

claimant is deemed to have satisfied the requirement in

tion taxation year if the following conditions are met:
(a) at least every four months, the incentive claimant

a taxation year,
(a) if the qualified CCUS project’s operations are af-

stantially all of the project period, then no amount is
payable by the taxpayer for the year under subsections
(3) to (5) in respect of the project; and
(b) in any other case, the portion of the project period
during which the project’s operations are affected by
the extraordinary circumstances shall be disregarded

(9) Except where subsection (11) applies, if at any time
in a particular taxation year a taxpayer disposes of or ex-
ports from Canada a property for which the taxpayer’s
qualified CCUS expenditure resulted in the determina-
tion of a cumulative CCUS development tax credit for a
previous taxation year, or would so result for the particu-
lar year but for this subsection, the following rules apply:
(a) if the time is before the total CCUS project review
period of the CCUS project to which the expenditure
relates, the expenditure is deemed not to be a qualified
CCUS expenditure in respect of the CCUS project for
the purpose of determining the taxpayer’s cumulative
CCUS development tax credit for the particular year
and any subsequent taxation years; and
(b) if the time is during the total CCUS project review
period of the CCUS project to which the expenditure
relates, there shall be added to the tax otherwise
payable by the taxpayer under this Part for the year

A
is the qualified CCUS expenditure in respect of the
property as determined for the taxation year that
includes the first day of commercial operations,
B
is the appropriate specified percentage,
C
is the amount, not exceeding the amount deter-
mined for D, equal to
(i) if the property is disposed of to a person
who deals at arm’s length with the taxpayer, the
proceeds of disposition of the property, or

who does not deal at arm’s length with the tax-
payer, or is exported from Canada but not

erty at that time,
D
is the taxpayer’s capital cost of the property, and
E
is the total of all amounts, each of which can rea-
sonably be considered to be the portion of any

extent that the amount did not reduce the tax
payable by the taxpayer under this subsection in a
preceding taxation year.
Refurbishment property disposition
(10) Except where subsection (11) applies, if at any time
in a particular taxation year during the total project re-
view period of a CCUS project a taxpayer disposes of or
removes from Canada a property for which the taxpayer’s
qualified CCUS expenditure resulted in the determina-
tion of a CCUS refurbishment tax credit for the year or a
previous taxation year, then there shall be added to the
tax otherwise payable by the taxpayer under this Part for
the year the amount determined by the formula
A × B × C ÷ D − E
where
A
is the qualified CCUS expenditure in respect of the
property;
B
is the appropriate specified percentage;
C
is the amount, not exceeding the amount determined
for D, equal to

ably be considered to be the portion of any amount
previously paid by the taxpayer because of subsec-

apply to determine amounts in respect of the partnership
as if the partnership were a taxable Canadian corpora-
tion, its fiscal period were its taxation year and it had de-
ducted all of the CCUS tax credits that were previously
added in computing the CCUS tax credit of any member
of the partnership under subsection 127.44(2) because of

66 (1) Section 245 of the Act is amended by
adding the following before subsection (1):
Preamble
245 (0.1) This section of the Act contains the general
anti-avoidance rule, which
(a) applies to deny the tax benefit of avoidance trans-
actions that result directly or indirectly either in a mis-
use of provisions of the Act (or any of the enactments
listed in subparagraphs (4)(a)(ii) to (v)) or an abuse
having regard to those provisions read as a whole,
while not preventing taxpayers from obtaining tax
benefits contemplated by Parliament; and
(b) strikes a balance between
(i) the Government of Canada’s responsibility to
protect the tax base and the fairness of the tax sys-
tem, and
(ii) taxpayers’ need for certainty in planning their
affairs.
(2) Subsection 245(3) of the Act is replaced by the
following:
Avoidance transaction
(3) Unless it may reasonably be considered that obtain-
ing the tax benefit is not one of the main purposes for un-
dertaking or arranging a transaction, the transaction is
an avoidance transaction if the transaction
(a) but for this section, would result, directly or indi-
rectly, in a tax benefit; or
(b) is part of a series of transactions, which series, but
for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, in
a tax benefit.
(3) Section 245 of the Act is amended by adding
the following after subsection (4):

Economic substance — effect
(4.1) If an avoidance transaction — or a series of trans-
actions that includes the avoidance transaction — is sig-
nificantly lacking in economic substance, this is an im-
portant consideration that tends to indicate that the
transaction results in a misuse under paragraph (4)(a) or
an abuse under paragraph (4)(b).
Economic substance — meaning
(4.2) Factors that establish that a transaction or series of
transactions is significantly lacking in economic sub-
stance may include, but are not limited to, any of the fol-
lowing:
(a) all or substantially all of the opportunity for gain
or profit and risk of loss of the taxpayer — taken to-
gether with those of all non-arm’s length taxpayers
(other than those non-arm’s length taxpayers who can
reasonably be considered, having regard to the cir-
cumstances viewed as a whole, to have economic in-
terests that are largely adverse from those of the tax-
payer) — remains unchanged, including because of
(i) a circular flow of funds,
(ii) offsetting financial positions,
(iii) the timing between steps in a series, or
(iv) the use of an accommodation party;
(b) it is reasonable to conclude that, at the time the
transaction or series was entered into, the expected
value of the tax benefit exceeded the expected non-tax
economic return (which excludes both the tax benefit
and any tax advantages connected to another jurisdic-
tion); and
(c) it is reasonable to conclude that the entire, or al-
most entire, purpose for undertaking or arranging the
transaction or series was to obtain the tax benefit.
(4) Section 245 of the Act is amended by adding
the following after subsection (5):
Penalty
(5.1) If subsection (2) applies to determine the tax con-
sequences to a person for a taxation year in respect of a
transaction that was not disclosed by the person to the
Minister in accordance with section 237.3 or 237.4, the
person is liable to a penalty for the taxation year equal to
the amount determined by the formula
(A + B) × 25% − C

where
A
is the amount by which the tax payable by the person
under this Act for the year exceeds the amount that
would have been payable by the person under this
Act for the year if subsection (2) had not applied in
respect of the transaction;
B
is the amount by which the total of all amounts, each
of which is an amount that would have been deemed
to be paid on account of the person’s tax payable un-
der Part I for the year if subsection (2) had not ap-
plied in respect of the transaction, exceeds the total
of all amounts that are deemed to be paid on account
of the person’s tax payable under Part I for the year;
and
C
is the amount of any penalty payable by the person
under subsection 163(2), to the extent that the
amount is in respect of the transaction or a series
that includes the transaction and did not reduce the
penalty payable by the person under this subsection
in a preceding taxation year.
Penalty — exception
(5.2) Subsection (5.1) does not apply to a person in re-
spect of a transaction if the person demonstrates that, at
the time that the transaction was entered into, it was rea-
sonable for the person to have concluded that subsection
(2) would not apply to the transaction in reliance on the
transaction or a series that includes the transaction being
identical or almost identical to a transaction or series
that was the subject of
(a) published administrative guidance or statements
made by the Minister or another relevant governmen-
tal authority; or
(b) one or more court decisions.
Provisions applicable

at any time of an undivided interest in, or for civil law an

because of this section and this Part applies to the trans-
feree with any modifications that the circumstances re-
quire.
Rules applicable

subsection (2), jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable
in respect of part or all of the liability of the transferor
under this Act, the following rules apply:
(a) a payment by the transferee on account of the
transferee’s liability discharges, to the extent of the

cause of subsection (2), jointly and severally, or soli-
darily, liable.
Anti-avoidance rules
(7) For the purposes of subsections (1) to (6), if a person
(referred to in this section as the “transferor”) has trans-

(a) the transferor is deemed to not be dealing at arm’s
length with the transferee at all times in the transac-
tion or series of transactions if
(i) the transferor and the transferee do not deal at
arm’s length at any time during the period begin-
ning immediately before the transaction or series of
transactions and ending immediately after the
transaction or series of transactions, and

transferor under this section for an amount payable
under this Act;
(b) an amount that the transferor is liable to pay un-
der this Act (including, for greater certainty, an
amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this
section, regardless of whether the Minister has made
an assessment under subsection (5) in respect of that
amount) is deemed to have become payable in the cal-
endar year in which the property was transferred, if it
is reasonable to conclude that one of the purposes of
the transfer of the property is to avoid the payment of
a future amount payable under this Act by the trans-
feror or transferee; and

is deemed to be the greater of
(i) the amount otherwise determined for A in para-
graph (2)(a) without reference to this paragraph,
and

A
is the fair market value of the property at the
time of the transfer, and

sideration (that is held by the transferor)
given for the property at any time during the
period beginning immediately before the
transaction or series of transactions and
ending immediately after the transaction or
series of transactions, or
(B) if the consideration is in a form that is
cancelled or extinguished during the period
referred to in clause (A),

eign-based information or record covered by that notice.

delay, apply to the Tax Court of Canada for an order ap-
pointing a hearing officer before whom the inquiry will

(4) A hearing officer appointed under subsection (2) in
relation to an inquiry must exercise the powers conferred
on a commissioner by section 4 of the Inquiries Act in re-
lation to any persons that the person authorized to make
the inquiry considers appropriate for the conduct of the
inquiry. However, the hearing officer is not to exercise
the power to punish any person unless, on application by
the hearing officer, a judge, including a judge of a county
court, certifies that the power may be exercised in the
matter disclosed in the application and the hearing offi-
cer has given to the person in respect of whom the power
is proposed to be exercised 24 hours notice of the hearing
of the application, or any shorter notice that the judge
considers reasonable.

rized under subsection (1) is entitled to be represented by
counsel and, on request made by the person to the Minis-
ter, to receive a transcript of that evidence.
Rights of person investigated
(6) Any person whose affairs are investigated in the
course of an inquiry authorized under subsection (1) is
entitled to be present and to be represented by counsel
throughout the inquiry unless the hearing officer ap-
pointed under subsection (2), on application by the Min-
ister or a person giving evidence, orders otherwise in re-
lation to all or any part of the inquiry on the ground that
the presence of the person and the person’s counsel, or
either of them, would be prejudicial to the effective con-
duct of the inquiry.

ty or binding interest created is subordinate to any

der the law of the province to be made or given by the su-
perior court of the province or by a judge or official of the

ceeding referred to in subsection (6), to any official in
the land registry system, personal property or movable
property registry system, or other registry system, of a
province, or

province to make the filing, registration or other

the same extent as if the memorial or document relating
to the memorial were a document that is evidence of a
judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount
referred to in paragraph (4)(b) for the purpose of a simi-
lar proceeding. However, if the memorial or document is
issued by the Federal Court or signed or certified by a
judge or official of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or
other evidence required under the law of the province to
be provided with or to accompany the memorial or docu-
ment in the proceedings is deemed to have been provided
with or to have accompanied the memorial or document
as so required.

be, is to be bound, seized, attached, charged or otherwise
affected as it would have been if that consent had been
given at the time that process was issued or the charge,

may be.
Completion of notices, etc.
(9) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or
other person in a minute, notice or document required to
be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsec-
tion (8), be so set out without the written consent of the
Minister, the sheriff or other person must complete the

out that information and, when that consent of the Min-
ister is given, a further minute, notice or document set-
ting out all the information must be completed for the
same purpose, and the sheriff or other person, having
complied with this subsection, is deemed to have com-
plied with the Act, regulation or rule requiring the infor-
mation to be set out in the minute, notice or document.

recording a memorial under subsection (4) is registered
in accordance with subsection 87(1) of the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act, it is deemed
(a) to be a claim that is secured by a security and that,

Garnishment
113 (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a
person is, or will be within one year, liable to make a pay-
ment to another person that is liable to pay an amount
under this Act (in this section referred to as a “debtor”),

to pay without delay, if the money is immediately

tion”) will loan or advance money to, or make a pay-
ment on behalf of, or make a payment in respect of a

debted to the institution and that has granted security
in respect of the indebtedness, or

vance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, a
debtor who the Minister knows or suspects

Effect of receipt
(3) A receipt issued by the Minister for money paid as re-
quired under this section is a good and sufficient dis-
charge of the original liability to the extent of the pay-
ment.
Effect of requirement
(4) If the Minister has, under this section, required a
person to pay to the Receiver General for Canada on ac-
count of a debtor’s liability under this Act money other-
wise payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent,
remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or another periodic
payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to
be made by the person to the debtor until the liability un-
der this Act is satisfied and the requirement operates to
require payments to the Receiver General for Canada out
of each such payment of any amount that is specified by
the Minister in a notice in writing.
Failure to comply
(5) A person that fails to comply with a requirement un-
der subsection (1) or (4) is liable to pay to His Majesty in
right of Canada an amount equal to the amount that the
person was required under that subsection to pay to the
Receiver General for Canada.
Other failures to comply
(6) An institution or person that fails to comply with a
requirement under subsection (2) with respect to money
to be loaned, advanced or paid is liable to pay to His
Majesty in right of Canada an amount equal to the lesser

and
(b) the amount that the institution or person was re-
quired under that subsection to pay to the Receiver
General for Canada.
Assessment
(7) The Minister may assess any person for any amount
payable under this section by the person to the Receiver
General for Canada and, if the Minister sends a notice of
assessment, sections 55 and 67 to 82 apply with any mod-
ifications that the circumstances require.
Time limit
(8) An assessment of an amount payable under this sec-
tion by a person to the Receiver General for Canada is
not to be made more than four years after the person

receives the notice from the Minister requiring the pay-
ment.
Effect of payment as required
(9) If an amount that would otherwise have been ad-
vanced, loaned or paid to or on behalf of a debtor is paid
by a person to the Receiver General for Canada in accor-
dance with a notice from the Minister issued under this
section, or with an assessment under subsection (7), the
person is deemed for all purposes to have advanced,
loaned or paid the amount to or on behalf of the debtor.
Recovery by deduction or set-off
114 If a person is indebted to His Majesty in right of
Canada under this Act, the Minister may require the re-
tention by way of deduction or set-off of any amount that
the Minister may specify out of any amount that may be
or become payable to that person by His Majesty in right
of Canada.
Acquisition of debtor’s property
115 For the purpose of collecting debts owed by a per-
son to His Majesty in right of Canada under this Act, the
Minister may purchase or otherwise acquire any interest
in, or for civil law any right in, the person’s property that
the Minister is given a right to acquire in legal proceed-
ings or under a court order or that is offered for sale or
redemption and may dispose of any interest or right so
acquired in any manner that the Minister considers rea-
sonable.
Money seized from debtor
116 (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a
person is holding money that was seized by a police offi-
cer, in the course of administering or enforcing the crimi-
nal law of Canada, from another person that is liable to
pay any amount under this Act (in this section referred to
as the “debtor”) and that is restorable to the debtor, the
Minister may in writing require the person to turn over
the money otherwise restorable to the debtor, in whole or
in part, to the Receiver General for Canada on account of
the debtor’s liability under this Act.
Receipt of Minister
(2) A receipt issued by the Minister for money turned
over as required under this section is a good and suffi-
cient discharge of the requirement to restore the money
to the debtor to the extent of the amount so turned over.
Seizure if failure to pay
117 (1) If a person fails to pay an amount as required
under this Act, the Minister may in writing give 30 days
notice to the person, addressed to their latest known ad-
dress, of the Minister’s intention to direct that the

may issue a certificate of the failure and direct that the
person’s goods and chattels, or movable property, be
seized.
Disposition
(2) Property that has been seized under subsection (1)
must be kept for 10 days at the expense and risk of the

is about to leave Canada, the Minister may, before the
day otherwise fixed for payment, by notice to the person
served personally or sent by confirmed delivery service
addressed to their latest known address, demand pay-
ment of any amount for which the person is liable under
this Act or would be so liable if the time for payment had
arrived, and the amount must be paid without delay de-
spite any other provision of this Act.
Seizure
(2) If a person fails to pay an amount required under
subsection (1), the Minister may direct that goods and
chattels, or movable property, of the person be seized,
and subsections 117(2) to (4) apply, with any modifica-
tions that the circumstances require.
Authorization to proceed without delay
119 (1) Despite section 110, if, on ex parte application
by the Minister, a judge is satisfied that there are reason-
able grounds to believe that the collection of all or any
part of an amount assessed in respect of a person would
be jeopardized by a delay in its collection, the judge
must, on any terms that the judge considers reasonable
in the circumstances, authorize the Minister to, without

an amount assessed in respect of a person may be grant-

that amount has not been sent to the person at or before
the time the application is made if the judge is satisfied
that the receipt of the notice of assessment by the person
would likely further jeopardize the collection of the
amount. For the purposes of sections 109, 112, 113, 114,
116 and 117, the amount in respect of which the autho-
rization is granted is deemed to be an amount payable
under this Act.
Affidavits
(3) Statements contained in an affidavit of a person filed
in the context of an application under this section may be
based on belief, in which case the affidavit must include
the grounds for that belief.
Service of authorization and notice of assessment

spect of a person must be served by the Minister on the
person within 72 hours after it is granted, unless the
judge orders the authorization to be served at some other
time specified in the authorization, and, if a notice of as-
sessment has not been sent to the person at or before the
time of the application, a notice of assessment for the as-
sessed period must be served on the person together with
the authorization.

son must be effected by

as and when required under this section, the Minister
may, as soon as practicable, apply to a judge for further
direction.

der this section in respect of a person, the person may, on
six clear days notice to the Deputy Attorney General of

as practicable.

plication of the person, be heard in camera, if the person

must determine the question summarily and may con-
firm, vary or set aside the authorization and make any
other order that the judge considers appropriate.
Directions

in connection with anything done or being done under
this section and there is no relevant direction in this sec-
tion, a judge may give any direction with regard to the

ate.
