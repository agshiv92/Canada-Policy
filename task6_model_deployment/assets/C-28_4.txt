70-71 ELIZABETH II
CHAPTER 11
An Act to amend the Criminal Code (self-induced ex-
treme intoxication)
[Assented to 23rd June, 2022]
Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate and House of Commons of Canada,
enacts as follows:
R.S., c. C-46
Criminal Code
1995, c. 32, s. 1
1 Section 33.1 of the Criminal Code and the head-
ing before it are replaced by the following:
Self-induced Extreme Intoxication
Offences of violence by negligence
33.1 (1) A person who, by reason of self-induced ex-
treme intoxication, lacks the general intent or voluntari-
ness ordinarily required to commit an offence referred to
in subsection (3), nonetheless commits the offence if
(a) all the other elements of the offence are present;
and
(b) before they were in a state of extreme intoxication,
they departed markedly from the standard of care ex-
pected of a reasonable person in the circumstances
with respect to the consumption of intoxicating sub-
stances.
Marked departure â€” foreseeability of risk and other
circumstances
(2) For the purposes of determining whether the person
departed markedly from the standard of care, the court
must consider the objective foreseeability of the risk that
the consumption of the intoxicating substances could
cause extreme intoxication and lead the person to harm
another person. The court must, in making the determi-
nation, also consider all relevant circumstances, includ-
ing anything that the person did to avoid the risk.

cation that renders a person unaware of, or incapable of
consciously controlling, their behaviour.
