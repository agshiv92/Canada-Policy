primarily as a health and social issue;
2021-2022
Chapter 15: An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
Sections 16-20

Page 7 
(b) interventions should be founded on evidence-
based best practices and should aim to protect the
health, dignity and human rights of individuals who
use drugs and to reduce harm to those individuals,
their families and their communities;
(c) criminal sanctions imposed in respect of the pos-
session of drugs for personal use can increase the stig-
ma associated with drug use and are not consistent
with established public health evidence;
(d) interventions should address the root causes of
problematic substance use, including by encouraging
measures such as education, treatment, aftercare, re-
habilitation and social reintegration; and
(e) judicial resources are more appropriately used in
relation to offences that pose a risk to public safety.
Warnings and Referrals
Warnings and referrals
10.2 (1) A peace officer shall, instead of laying an infor-
mation against an individual alleged to have committed
an offence under subsection 4(1), consider whether it
would be preferable, having regard to the principles set
out in section 10.1, to take no further action, to warn the
individual or, with the consent of the individual, to refer
the individual to a program or to an agency or other ser-
vice provider in the community that may assist the indi-
vidual.
Subsequent charges not invalidated
(2) The failure of a peace officer to consider the options
set out in subsection (1) does not invalidate any subse-
quent charges laid against the individual for the offence.
Prosecution — limits
10.3 A prosecution may be commenced or continued
against an individual alleged to have committed an of-
fence under subsection 4(1) only if, having regard to the
principles set out in section 10.1, the prosecutor is of the
opinion that the use of a warning or referral under sec-
tion 10.2, or of alternative measures as defined in sec-
tion 716 of the Criminal Code, is not appropriate, and a
prosecution is appropriate in the circumstances.

or referral mentioned in subsection 10.2(1), evidence that
a peace officer has taken no further action in respect of
an offence under subsection 4(1) and evidence of the of-
fence are inadmissible for the purpose of proving prior
offending behaviour in any proceedings before a court in

separate and apart from other records of convictions

specting the use, removal or destruction of records kept
separate and apart referred to in subsections (1) and (2).
