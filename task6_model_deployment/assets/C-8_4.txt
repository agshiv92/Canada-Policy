cumstances, in the manner and for the purposes set out in a
measure entitled “An Act to implement certain provisions of the
economic and fiscal update tabled in Parliament on December
14, 2021 and other measures”.
SUMMARY

tions in order to
(a) introduce a new refundable tax credit for eligible busi-
nesses on qualifying ventilation expenses made to improve
air quality;

deduction by giving all northern residents the option to claim
up to $1,200 in eligible travel expenses even if the individual

and expand the eligibility criteria to include electronic devices
used by eligible educators; and

non-Canadians. It sets out rules for the purpose of establishing
owners’ liability for the tax. It also sets out applicable reporting
and filing requirements. Finally, to promote compliance with its
provisions, this Act includes modern administration and enforce-
ment provisions aligned with those found in other taxation
statutes.
Part 3 provides for a six-year limitation or prescription period for
the recovery of amounts owing with respect to a loan provided
under the Canada Emergency Business Account program estab-
lished by Export Development Canada.

Revenue Fund for the purpose of supporting ventilation im-
provement projects in schools.

may be, of a separate person;
(b) the person and the receiver are jointly and several-
ly, or solidarily, liable for the payment of any amount
that is required to be paid by the person under this Act
before or during the period during which the receiver
is acting as receiver of the person to the extent that the
amount can reasonably be considered to relate to the
relevant assets of the receiver or to the businesses,

ceiver had been acting as receiver of the person at the
time the amount became payable except that
(i) the receiver is liable for the payment of any
amount that is required to be paid by the person
under this Act before that period only to the extent

person; and
(d) if the person has not on or before the particular
day filed a return required under this Act to be filed by
the person for a calendar year of the person ending on
or before the particular day, the receiver must, unless
the Minister waives in writing the requirement for the
receiver to file the return, file with the Minister in the
prescribed form and manner a return for that calendar
year that relates to the businesses, properties, affairs
or assets of the person that would have been the rele-
vant assets of the receiver if the receiver had been act-
ing as receiver of the person during that calendar year.

erty of another person that is required to pay any amount

the conclusion of any investigation into the offence in re-
lation to which the record or thing was seized or until it is
required to be produced for the purposes of a criminal
proceeding.
Return of records or things seized
(7) If any record or thing seized under subsection (1) or

this section.
Access and copies

to provide any foreign-based information or record.
Notice
(3) A notice referred to in subsection (2) must set out
(a) a reasonable period of not less than 90 days for the
provision of the information or record;

ined or to whom it is provided or any officer of the
Canada Revenue Agency may make or cause to be made
one or more copies of it and, in the case of an electronic
record, make or cause to be made a print-out of the elec-
tronic record, and any record purporting to be certified
by the Minister or an authorized person to be a copy of
the record, or to be a print-out of an electronic record,
made under this section is evidence of the nature and
content of the original record and has the same probative
force as the original record would have if it were proven
in the ordinary way.

so, do everything the person is required to do by or in ac-
cordance with any of sections 31 and 62 to 66 and no per-

son, require security in a form satisfactory to the Minis-
ter and in an amount up to a specified amount that is the

determined by the formula
C – (D ÷ 2)
where
C

Registration in court
(2) On production to the Federal Court, a certificate
made under subsection (1) in respect of a debtor must be
registered in the Court and when so registered has the
same effect, and all proceedings may be taken on the cer-
tificate, as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court
against the debtor for a debt in the amount certified plus
interest on the amount as provided under this Act to the
day of payment and, for the purposes of those proceed-
ings, the certificate is deemed to be a judgment of the
Court against the debtor for a debt due to Her Majesty in
right of Canada and enforceable as such.
Costs
(3) All reasonable costs and charges incurred or paid for
the registration in the Federal Court of a certificate made
under subsection (1) or in respect of any proceedings tak-
en to collect the amount certified are recoverable in like
manner as if they had been included in the amount certi-
fied in the certificate when it was registered.
Charge on property
(4) A document issued by the Federal Court evidencing a
registered certificate in respect of a debtor, a writ of that
Court issued pursuant to the certificate or any notifica-
tion of the document or writ (which document, writ or
notification is in this section referred to as a “memorial”)
may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded for the
purpose of creating a charge, lien or priority on, or a
binding interest in property in a province, or any interest
in, or for civil law any right in, such property, held by the
debtor, in the same manner as a document evidencing
(a) a judgment of the superior court of the province
against a person for a debt owing by the person, or
(b) an amount payable or required to be remitted by a
person in the province in respect of a debt owing to
Her Majesty in right of the province
may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded in accor-
dance with the law of the province to create a charge, lien
or priority on, or a binding interest in, the property or in-
terest.
Creation of charge
(5) If a memorial has been filed, registered or otherwise
recorded under subsection (4),
(a) a charge, lien or priority is created on, or a binding
interest is created in, property in the province, or any
interest in, or for civil law any right in, such property,
held by the debtor, or

(b) such property, or interest or right in the property,
is otherwise bound,
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
memorial were a document evidencing a judgment re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to in
paragraph (4)(b), and the charge, lien, priority or binding
interest created is subordinate to any charge, lien, priori-
ty or binding interest in respect of which all steps neces-
sary to make it effective against other creditors were
taken before the time the memorial was filed, registered
or otherwise recorded.
Proceedings in respect of memorial
(6) If a memorial is filed, registered or otherwise record-
ed in a province under subsection (4), proceedings may
be taken in the province in respect of the memorial, in-
cluding proceedings
(a) to enforce payment of the amount evidenced by
the memorial, interest on the amount and all costs and
charges paid or incurred in respect of
(i) the filing, registration or other recording of the
memorial, and
(ii) proceedings taken to collect the amount,
(b) to renew or otherwise prolong the effectiveness of
the filing, registration or other recording of the memo-
rial,
(c) to cancel or withdraw the memorial wholly or in
respect of any of the property, or interests or rights,
affected by the memorial, or
(d) to postpone the effectiveness of the filing, registra-
tion or other recording of the memorial in favour of
any right, charge, lien or priority that has been or is
intended to be filed, registered or otherwise recorded
in respect of any property, or interest or rights, affect-
ed by the memorial,
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
memorial were a document evidencing a judgment re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to in
paragraph (4)(b), except that, if in any such proceeding
or as a condition precedent to any such proceeding, any
order, consent or ruling is required under the law of the
province to be made or given by the superior court of the
province or by a judge or official of the court, a like order,
consent or ruling may be made or given by the Federal
Court or by a judge or official of the Federal Court and,
when so made or given, has the same effect for the pur-
poses of the proceeding as if it were made or given by the
superior court of the province or by a judge or official of
the court.

Presentation of documents
(7) If
(a) a memorial is presented for filing, registration or
other recording under subsection (4), or a document
relating to the memorial is presented for filing, regis-
tration or other recording for the purpose of any pro-
ceeding described in subsection (6), to any official in
the land registry system, personal property or movable
property registry system, or other registry system, of a
province, or
(b) access is sought to any person, place or thing in a
province to make the filing, registration or other
recording,
the memorial or document must be accepted for filing,
registration or other recording or the access must be
granted, as the case may be, in the same manner and to
the same extent as if the memorial or document relating
to the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment
referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to
in paragraph (4)(b) for the purpose of a like proceeding,
except that, if the memorial or document is issued by the
Federal Court or signed or certified by a judge or official
of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or other evidence
required under the law of the province to be provided
with or to accompany the memorial or document in the
proceedings is deemed to have been provided with or to
have accompanied the memorial or document as so re-
quired.
Prohibition — disposition without consent
(8) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, a sheriff
or other person must not, without the written consent of
the Minister, sell or otherwise dispose of any property or
publish any notice or otherwise advertise in respect of
any sale or other disposition of any property pursuant to
any process issued or charge, lien, priority or binding in-
terest created in any proceeding to collect an amount cer-
tified in a certificate made under subsection (1), interest
on the amount or costs. However, if that consent is sub-
sequently given, any property that would have been af-
fected by that process, charge, lien, priority or binding
interest if the Minister’s consent had been given at the
time that process was issued or the charge, lien, priority
or binding interest was created, as the case may be, is
bound, seized, attached, charged or otherwise affected as
it would be if that consent had been given at the time that
process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding
interest was created, as the case may be.
Completion of notices, etc.
(9) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or
other person in a minute, notice or document required to
be completed for any purpose cannot, because of

Page 93 
subsection (8), be so set out without the written consent
of the Minister, the sheriff or other person must com-
plete the minute, notice or document to the extent possi-
ble without that information and, when that consent of
the Minister is given, a further minute, notice or docu-
ment setting out all the information must be completed
for the same purpose, and the sheriff or other person,
having complied with this subsection, is deemed to have
complied with this Act, regulation or rule requiring the
information to be set out in the minute, notice or docu-
ment.
Application for order
(10) A sheriff or other person that is unable, because of
subsection (8) or (9), to comply with any law or rule of
court is bound by any order made by a judge of the Fed-
eral Court, on an ex parte application by the Minister, for
the purpose of giving effect to the proceeding, charge,
lien, priority or binding interest.
Secured claims
(11) If a charge, lien, priority or binding interest created
under subsection (5) by filing, registering or otherwise
recording a memorial under subsection (4) is registered
in accordance with subsection 87(1) of the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act, it is deemed
(a) to be a claim that is secured by a security and that,
subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a se-
cured claim under that Act; and
(b) to also be a claim referred to in paragraph 86(2)(a)
of that Act.
Details in certificates and memorials
(12) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, in any
certificate in respect of a debtor, any memorial evidenc-
ing a certificate or any writ or document issued for the
purpose of collecting an amount certified, it is sufficient
for all purposes
(a) to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor,
the total of amounts payable by the debtor without
setting out the separate amounts making up that total;
and
(b) to refer to the rate of interest or penalty to be
charged on the separate amounts making up the
amount payable in general terms
(i) in the case of interest, as interest at the specified
rate under this Act applicable from time to time on
amounts payable to the Receiver General, without

under this Act (in this section referred to as a “debtor”),
the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the person

tion”) will loan or advance money to, or make a pay-
ment on behalf of, or make a payment in respect of a

quired under this section is a good and sufficient dis-
charge of the original liability to the extent of the pay-
ment.
Effect of requirement
(4) If the Minister has, under this section, required a
person to pay to the Receiver General, on account of the
liability under this Act of a debtor, money otherwise
payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent, re-
muneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic
payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to
be made by the person to the debtor until the liability un-
der this Act is satisfied and operates to require payments
to the Receiver General out of each such payment of any
amount that is stipulated by the Minister in a notice in
writing.
Failure to comply
(5) Every person that fails to comply with a requirement
under subsection (1) or (4) is liable to pay to Her Majesty

requirement under subsection (2) with respect to money
to be loaned, advanced or paid is liable to pay to Her

quired under that subsection to pay to the Receiver
General.

payable under this section by the person to the Receiver
General and, if the Minister sends a notice of assessment,

(9) If an amount that would otherwise have been ad-
vanced, loaned or paid to or on behalf of a debtor is paid
by a person to the Receiver General in accordance with a

deemed for all purposes to have advanced, loaned or paid
the amount to or on behalf of the debtor.
Recovery by deduction or set-off
74 If a person is indebted to Her Majesty in right of
Canada under this Act, the Minister may require the re-
tention by way of deduction or set-off of any amount that

or become payable to that person by Her Majesty in right
of Canada.
Acquisition of debtor’s property
75 For the purpose of collecting debts owed by a person
to Her Majesty in right of Canada under this Act, the
Minister may purchase or otherwise acquire any interest
in, or for civil law any right in, the person’s property that
the Minister is given a right to acquire in legal proceed-
ings or under a court order or that is offered for sale or
redemption and may dispose of any interest or right so
acquired in any manner that the Minister considers rea-
sonable.
Money seized from debtor
76 (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a
person is holding money that was seized by a police offi-
cer in the course of administering or enforcing the crimi-
nal law of Canada from another person that is liable to
pay any amount under this Act (in this section referred to
as the “debtor”) and that is restorable to the debtor, the
Minister may in writing require the person to turn over
the money otherwise restorable to the debtor, in whole or
in part, to the Receiver General on account of the
debtor’s liability under this Act.
Receipt of Minister
(2) A receipt issued by the Minister for money turned
over as required under this section is a good and suffi-
cient discharge of the requirement to restore the money
to the debtor to the extent of the amount so turned over.
Seizure
77 (1) If a person fails to pay an amount as required un-
der this Act, the Minister may in writing give 30 days no-

superior court of the province in which the seizure is
made is exempt from seizure under this section.

is about to leave Canada, the Minister may, before the
day otherwise fixed for payment, by notice to the person
served personally or sent by confirmed delivery service
addressed to their latest known address, demand pay-
ment of any amount for which the person is liable under
this Act or would be so liable if the time for payment had
arrived, and the amount must be paid without delay de-
spite any other provision of this Act.
Seizure
(2) If a person fails to pay an amount required under
subsection (1), the Minister may direct that things of the
person be seized, and subsections 77(2) to (4) apply, with
any modifications that the circumstances require.
Authorization to assess and take collection action
79 (1) Despite section 70, if, on ex parte application by
the Minister relating to a calendar year made on or after
the last day of the calendar year, a judge is satisfied that
there are reasonable grounds to believe that tax for the
calendar year will be required to be paid to the Receiver
General under subsection 6(3) and that the collection of
all or any part of that tax would be jeopardized by a delay
in its collection, the judge must, on any terms that the
judge considers reasonable in the circumstances, autho-
rize the Minister to, without delay,

granted under subsection (1) in respect of an application
relating to a calendar year of a person
(a) the particular day on or before which the person is
required to file a return under section 7 for the calen-
dar year is deemed to be the day on which a judge
hears the application for the authorization;
(b) the tax for the calendar year is deemed to have be-
come due to the Receiver General on the particular
day; and
(c) sections 23, 47, 49, 51 and 52 apply as if the tax for
the calendar year were not required to be paid, and the
return for that calendar year were not required to be
filed, until the last day of the period described in sub-
section (8).
Affidavits
(3) Statements contained in an affidavit filed in the con-
text of an application under this section may be based on
belief in which case it must include the grounds for that
belief.
Service of authorization and notice of assessment
(4) An authorization granted under subsection (1) in re-
spect of a person must be served by the Minister on the
person within 72 hours after it is granted, except if the
judge orders the authorization to be served at some other
time specified in the authorization, and a notice of as-
sessment for the calendar year must be served on the
person together with the authorization.

must be effected by personal service on the person or ser-
vice in accordance with the directions of a judge.

rization was served on the person in accordance with
this section; or

being satisfied that the application was made as soon
as practicable.
Hearing in camera
(9) An application by a person under subsection (7) may,
on the application of the person, be heard in private, if
the person establishes to the satisfaction of the judge that
the circumstances of the case justify proceedings heard in
private.
Disposition of application

must determine the question summarily and may con-
firm, vary or set aside the authorization and make any
other order that the judge considers appropriate.

tion, a judge may give any direction with regard to the

means, to
(a) the transferor’s spouse or common-law partner or
an individual that has since become the transferor’s
spouse or common-law partner,
(b) an individual that was under 18 years of age, or
(c) another person with whom the transferor was not
dealing at arm’s length,
the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally, or
solidarily, liable to pay under this Act an amount equal to
the lesser of
(d) the amount determined by the formula
A – B
where
A
is the amount, if any, by which the fair market val-
ue of the property at that time exceeds the fair
market value at that time of the consideration giv-
en by the transferee for the transfer of the proper-
ty, and
B
is the amount, if any, by which the amount as-
sessed the transferee under subsection 325(2) of
the Excise Tax Act, paragraph 97.44(1)(b) of the
Customs Act, subsection 160(2) of the Income Tax
Act, subsection 297(3) of the Excise Act, 2001 or
subsection 161(3) of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution
Pricing Act in respect of the property exceeds the
amount paid by the transferor in respect of the
amount so assessed, and
(e) the total of all amounts each of which is
(i) an amount that the transferor is liable to pay un-
der this Act for the calendar year of the transferor
that includes that time or any preceding calendar
year of the transferor, or
(ii) interest or penalty for which the transferor is li-
able as of that time,
but nothing in this subsection limits the liability of the
transferor under this Act.
Fair market value of undivided interest
(2) For the purpose of this section, the fair market value
at any time of an undivided interest in a property, ex-
pressed as a proportionate interest in that property, is,
subject to subsection (5), deemed to be equal to the same

proportion of the fair market value of that property at
that time.
Assessment
(3) The Minister may at any time assess a transferee in
respect of any amount payable by reason of this section,
and the provisions of sections 15 and 33 to 46 apply, with
any modifications that the circumstances require.
Rules applicable
(4) If a transferor and transferee have, by reason of sub-
section (1), become jointly and severally, or solidarily, li-
able in respect of part or all of the liability of the transfer-
or under this Act, the following rules apply:
(a) a payment by the transferee on account of the
transferee’s liability must, to the extent of the pay-
ment, discharge their liability; and
(b) a payment by the transferor on account of the
transferor’s liability only discharges the transferee’s li-
ability to the extent that the payment operates to re-
duce the transferor’s liability to an amount less than
the amount in respect of which the transferee was, by
subsection (1), made jointly and severally, or solidari-
ly, liable.
Transfers to spouse or common-law partner
(5) Despite subsection (1), if at any time an individual
transfers property to the individual’s spouse or common-
law partner under a decree, order or judgment of a com-
petent tribunal or under a written separation agreement
and, at that time, the individual and the individual’s
spouse or common-law partner were separated and living
apart as a result of the breakdown of their marriage or
common-law partnership as defined in subsection
248(1) of the Income Tax Act, for the purposes of para-
graph (1)(d), the fair market value at that time of the
property so transferred is deemed to be nil, but nothing
in this subsection limits the liability of the individual un-
der this Act.
