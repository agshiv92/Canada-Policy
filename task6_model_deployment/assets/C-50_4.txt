Whereas the Paris Agreement acknowledges the

best available scientific knowledge and recognizes
the imperative of the creation of decent work and
quality jobs consistent with Canada’s nationally de-

contribute to making Canada’s economy more re-
silient, inclusive and competitive;
Whereas climate change is a global problem that re-
quires immediate and ambitious action by all govern-
ments in Canada — as well as by industry, labour, In-
digenous peoples, non-governmental organizations
and individual Canadians — and has disproportion-
ate impacts, including on vulnerable groups and indi-
viduals;
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to
undertaking measures for climate change mitigation
and to achieving and exceeding the target for 2030
set out in its nationally determined contribution that

Whereas the Government of Canada recognizes that

Body through a decision adopted on November 5,
2015;
Whereas the Government of Canada’s approach to
building a net-zero economy will be guided by the
following principles:

jobs approach should engage relevant stakehold-
ers and partners, including through social dia-
logue, to build strong social consensus in the shift

able jobs should

communities, non-governmental organizations and
the governments of the provinces and territories,
which all have a role to play in building a net-zero
economy;
Whereas the governments of the provinces and terri-
