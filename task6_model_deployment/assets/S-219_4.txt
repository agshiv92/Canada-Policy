CHAPTER 16
An Act respecting a National Ribbon Skirt Day
[Assented to 15th December, 2022]
Preamble
Whereas Indigenous women are life-givers and are
entrusted with traditional knowledge to care for
their families, their communities and the environ-
ment;
Whereas the ribbon skirt is a centuries-old spiritual
symbol of womanhood, identity, adaptation and sur-
vival and is a way for women to honour themselves
and their culture;
Whereas the ribbon skirt represents a direct connec-
tion to Mother Earth and its sacred medicines;
Whereas Indigenous culture, tradition and ceremony,
including Indigenous ties to language and the land,
are critical to the vitality and well-being of Canada’s
First Peoples;
Whereas section 1 of Article 15 of the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to
which Canada is a signatory, states, “Indigenous
peoples have the right to the dignity and diversity of
their cultures, traditions, histories and aspirations
which shall be appropriately reflected in education
and public information”;
Whereas Call for Justice 2.1 of the Final Report of the
National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indige-
nous Women and Girls calls “upon all governments
to acknowledge, recognize, and protect the rights of
Indigenous Peoples to their cultures and languages
as inherent rights, and constitutionally protected as
such under section 35 of the Constitution [Act,
1982]”;
And whereas Call for Justice 15.2 of that report calls
on Canadians to “[d]ecolonize by learning the true
history of Canada … and learn about and celebrate
Indigenous Peoples’ history, cultures, pride, and di-
versity”;
