BILL S-8

SUMMARY
This enactment amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection
Act to, among other things,
(a) reorganize existing inadmissibility provisions relating to
sanctions to establish a distinct ground of inadmissibility
based on sanctions;
(b) expand the scope of inadmissibility based on sanctions to
include not only sanctions imposed on a country but also
those imposed on an entity or a person; and
(c) expand the scope of inadmissibility based on sanctions to
include all orders and regulations made under section 4 of
the Special Economic Measures Act.
It also makes consequential amendments to the Citizenship Act
and the Emergencies Act.
Finally, it amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regu-
lations to, among other things, provide that the Minister of Pub-
lic Safety and Emergency Preparedness, instead of the Immigra-
tion Division, will have the authority to issue a removal order on
grounds of inadmissibility based on sanctions under new para-
graph 35.1(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
