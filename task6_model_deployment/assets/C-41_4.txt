involved in carrying out the activity proposed in the
application has any links to a terrorist group;
(b) the likelihood that the applicant or any person
who is to be involved in carrying out that activity will
be acting for the benefit of, at the direction of or in as-
sociation with a terrorist group in carrying out the ac-
tivity; and

fence.

change of circumstances.
