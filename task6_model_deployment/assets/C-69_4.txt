ness. It sets out rules for the purposes of establishing liability for

erally aligned with those found in other taxation statutes. Finally,

other texts to ensure proper implementation of the tax and cohe-
sive and efficient administration by the Canada Revenue Agency.

lution Pricing Act and other related texts in order to implement
certain measures.

temporary relief for supplies of certain face masks or respirators
and certain face shields from the Goods and Services Tax/
Harmonized Sales Tax.

and other related texts in order to implement changes to
(a) the federal excise duty framework for tobacco products

(i) increasing the excise duty rates for tobacco products,
including imposing a tax on inventories of cigarettes held
by retailers and wholesalers,
(ii) changing the process by which brands of tobacco
products for export are exempted from special excise duty
and marking requirements,
(iii) allowing certain information to be shared for the ad-
ministration or enforcement of the Tobacco and Vaping
Products Act, and
(iv) requiring the filing of information returns in respect of
tobacco excise stamps;
(b) the federal excise duty framework for vaping products by
increasing the excise duty rates for vaping products; and
(c) the federal excise duty framework for alcohol by
(i) extending by two years the two per cent cap on the in-
flation adjustment on beer, spirits and wine excise duties,
and
(ii) cutting by half for two years the excise duty rate on
the first 15,000 hectolitres of beer brewed in Canada.

repaid (or has not received and can no longer reasonably
be expected to receive) an amount of government assis-
tance or non-government assistance that was applied to
reduce the capital cost of an eligible clean hydrogen
property under paragraph (10)(c) for a preceding taxa-
tion year, the amount repaid (or no longer expected to be
received) is to be added to the cost to the taxpayer of a
property acquired in the particular year for the purpose

of determining the taxpayer’s clean hydrogen tax credit
for the year.
Partnerships
(12) Subject to section 127.491, where, in a particular
taxation year of a qualifying taxpayer who is a member of
a partnership, an amount would be determined under
subsection (2) in respect of the partnership, for its taxa-
tion year that ends in the particular year, if the partner-
ship were a taxable Canadian corporation and its fiscal
period were its taxation year, the portion of that amount
that can reasonably be considered to be the taxpayer’s
share thereof shall be added in computing the clean hy-
drogen tax credit of the taxpayer at the end of the partic-
ular year.
Unpaid amounts
(13) For the purposes of this section, where any part of
the capital cost of a taxpayer’s eligible clean hydrogen
property is unpaid on the day that is 180 days after the
end of the taxation year in which a deduction in respect
of a clean hydrogen tax credit would otherwise be avail-
able in respect of the property, such amount is to be
(a) excluded from the capital cost of the property in
the year; and
(b) added to the capital cost of the property at the
time it is paid.
Tax shelter investment
(14) Subsection (2) does not apply if an eligible clean hy-
drogen property – or an interest in a person or partner-
ship that has, directly or indirectly, an interest in, or for
civil law, a right in, such property – is a tax shelter in-
vestment for the purpose of section 143.2.
Annual information reporting requirement
(15) If a clean hydrogen tax credit was deducted in any
taxation year by a taxpayer in respect of a qualified clean
hydrogen project, the taxpayer shall file, with its return

Compliance — annual carbon intensity reporting
(16) If a clean hydrogen tax credit was deducted by a
taxpayer in respect of a qualified clean hydrogen project,
the taxpayer shall file with the Minister and the Minister
of Natural Resources, within 180 days after the end of
each operating year, a compliance report in prescribed
form and manner including
(a) the actual carbon intensity of the hydrogen pro-
duced by the project during the year;
(b) the quantity, in kilograms, of hydrogen that is pro-
duced by the project during the year;
(c) any shutdown time of the project in respect of the
year;
(d) for the compliance report in respect of the fifth op-
erating year, a report that verifies the actual carbon in-
tensity of the hydrogen produced during each operat-
ing year of the compliance period, prepared by a quali-
fied verification firm in respect of the project; and
(e) any information required in guidelines published
by the Minister of Natural Resources, including the
Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credit – Validation
and Verification Guidance Document.
Failure to report
(17) Each taxpayer that fails to file a compliance report
for a project as described in subsection (16) is liable to a
penalty, for each such failure, in an amount, not exceed-
ing the total of all clean hydrogen tax credits deducted by
the taxpayer in respect of the project, equal to the
amount determined by the formula
((4% × A) ÷ 365) × B
where
A
is the total of all amounts, each of which is the
amount of a clean hydrogen tax credit in respect of
the project deducted by the taxpayer for a taxation
year that ended before the applicable date in subsec-
tion (16); and
B
is the number of days during which the failure con-
tinues.
Recovery — change in carbon intensity
(18) In the taxation year of a taxpayer in which the com-
pliance period of the taxpayer’s qualified clean hydrogen
project ends, if the average actual carbon intensity of the
hydrogen produced is greater than the most recent

expected carbon intensity that was used to determine a
clean hydrogen tax credit in respect of the project, there
shall be added to the taxpayer’s tax otherwise payable
under this Part for the taxation year an amount equal to
the total of all amounts, each of which is determined by
the formula
(A − B) × C
where
A
is the specified percentage that was applied to the
capital cost of the eligible clean hydrogen property
forming part of the project in determining a clean
hydrogen tax credit of the taxpayer;
B
is the specified percentage that would have applied
to the capital cost of the property if the expected car-
bon intensity were equal to the average actual carbon
intensity of the project; and
C
is the capital cost of the property on which the clean
hydrogen tax credit was deducted.
Minister’s determination
(19) For the purpose of subsection (18), the Minister of
Natural Resources shall review each of the taxpayer’s
compliance reports described in subsection (16) and the
Minister may, in consultation with the Minister of Natu-
ral Resources, make a determination or redetermination
of the actual carbon intensity of the hydrogen produced
by a taxpayer’s clean hydrogen project for any operating
year during the compliance period of the project.
De minimis exception
(20) Subsection (18) does not apply to a taxpayer if the
difference between the average actual carbon intensity of
the taxpayer’s qualified clean hydrogen project and the
expected carbon intensity of the project is 0.5 or less.
Recapture of clean hydrogen tax credit — application
(21) Subsection (22) applies in a taxation year if
(a) a taxpayer acquired an eligible clean hydrogen
property in the year or any of the preceding 20 calen-
dar years;
(b) the taxpayer became entitled to a clean hydrogen
tax credit in respect of the capital cost, or a portion of
the capital cost, of the property; and
(c) in the year, the property is converted to a non-hy-
drogen or ammonia use, is exported from Canada or is

disposed of without having been previously exported
or converted to a non-hydrogen or ammonia use.
Recapture of clean hydrogen tax credit
(22) If this subsection applies for a taxation year in re-
spect of an eligible clean hydrogen property, there shall
be added to the taxpayer’s tax otherwise payable under
this Part for the year an amount determined by the for-
mula
(A – B) × (C ÷ D)
where
A
is the amount of the taxpayer’s clean hydrogen tax
credit in respect of the property;
B
is the total of all amounts, each of which can reason-
ably be considered to be the portion of any amount
previously paid by the taxpayer because of subsec-
tion (18) in respect of the property;
C
is an amount, not exceeding the amount determined
for D, equal to
(a) if the property is disposed of to a person or
partnership who deals at arm’s length with the
taxpayer, the proceeds of disposition of the prop-
erty, and
(b) in any other case, the fair market value of the
property; and
D
is the capital cost of the property on which the clean
hydrogen tax credit was deducted.
Election — sale of clean hydrogen project
(23) If at any time a qualifying taxpayer (referred to in
this subsection as the “vendor”) disposes of all or sub-
stantially all of its property comprising a qualified clean
hydrogen project of the taxpayer to another taxable
Canadian corporation (referred to in this subsection as
the “purchaser”), and the vendor and the purchaser joint-
ly elect in prescribed form, on or before the day that is
the earliest of the days on or before which any taxpayer
making the election is required to file a return of income
pursuant to section 150 for the taxation year in which the
transaction occurred, to have this subsection apply, the
following rules apply:
(a) the purchaser is deemed to have acquired any eli-
gible clean hydrogen property of the vendor at the
times acquired by the vendor;

Page 89 
(b) the provisions of this Act that applied to the ven-
dor in respect of the property that are relevant to the
application of the Act in respect of the property after
that time are deemed to have applied to the purchaser
and, for greater certainty, the purchaser is deemed to
have claimed the clean hydrogen tax credits deter-
mined under subsection (2) that could have been
claimed by the vendor, before that time, in respect of
the project;
(c) any clean hydrogen project plans that were filed by
the vendor in respect of the project before that time
are deemed to have been filed by the purchaser;
(d) the purchaser is or will be liable for amounts in re-
spect of the property for which the vendor would be li-
able under this section in respect of actions, transac-
tions or events that occur after that time as if the ven-
dor had undertaken them or otherwise participated in
them; and
(e) subsection (22) does not apply to the vendor in re-
spect of the disposition of property to the purchaser.
Recapture event reporting requirement
(24) If subsection (22) applies to a taxpayer or partner-
ship for a particular year, the taxpayer or partnership, as
the case may be, shall notify the Minister in prescribed
form and manner on or before the taxpayer’s filing-due
date for the year or the day when a return is required by
section 229 of the Income Tax Regulations to be filed in
respect of the fiscal period of the partnership.
Recovery and recapture — partnerships
(25) If subsection (12) has at any time applied to add an
amount in computing the clean hydrogen tax credit of a
member of a partnership, subsections (18) to (23) apply
to determine amounts in respect of the partnership as if
the partnership was a taxable Canadian corporation, its
fiscal period were its taxation year and it had deducted
all of the clean hydrogen tax credits that were previously
added in computing the clean hydrogen tax credit of any
member of the partnership because of the application of
subsection (12) in respect of its partnership interest.

a taxpayer is a member of a partnership, the amount that
can reasonably be considered to be the taxpayer’s share
of any amount of tax determined because of subsection
(25) in respect of the partnership shall be added to the
taxpayer’s tax otherwise payable under this Part for the
year.
Election by member
(27) A taxable Canadian corporation that is a member of
a partnership during a fiscal period of the partnership
may elect, in prescribed form and manner, to add to its
tax payable under this Part for its taxation year that in-
cludes the end of the fiscal period the total amount of tax
determined for a taxation year because of subsection (25)
in respect of the partnership.
Joint, several and solidary liability
(28) Each member of a partnership is jointly and sever-
ally, or solidarily, liable for any portion of the amount of
tax – determined because of subsection (25) in respect of
the partnership for a taxation year – that is not added to
the tax payable
(a) of a member of the partnership under subsection
(26); or
(b) of a taxable Canadian corporation because of sub-
section (27) and paid by the corporation by its filing-
due date for the year.
Interest on recovery tax
(29) For the purpose of applying subsection 161(1) to an
amount of tax payable because of subsection (18) (other
than an amount payable because of subsection (8)), the
balance-due day of a taxpayer is deemed to be the bal-

Capital gains deduction — qualifying business
transfers
(2) If this subsection applies to an individual, in comput-
ing the taxable income for a taxation year of the individu-
al, there may be deducted such amount as the individual
may claim not exceeding the least of
(a) the amount that would be determined in respect of
the individual for the year under paragraph 3(b) (to
the extent that that amount is not included in comput-
ing 
an 
amount 
determined 
under 
paragraph
110.6(2)(d) or (2.1)(d) for the individual) in respect of
capital gains and capital losses if the only properties
referred to in paragraph 3(b) were the subject shares
of the individual, and
(b) an amount determined by the formula
A × B × C − D
where
A
is the elected amount (within the meaning of
clause (1)(e)(ii)(A)) included in the joint election
referred to in paragraph (1)(e),
B
is
(i) 1, unless more than one individual is enti-
tled to a deduction under this subsection in re-
spect of the qualifying business transfer,
(ii) the percentage assigned to the individual in
the joint election referred to in paragraph
(1)(e), if a percentage is assigned to the individ-
ual in accordance with clause (1)(e)(ii)(B), and
(iii) in any other case, nil,
C
is the fraction of the taxpayer’s capital gain from
the disposition of the subject shares that is a tax-
able capital gain under paragraph 38(a) that ap-
plies to the subject shares in the year, and
D
is the total of each amount claimed by the taxpay-
er under this subsection in a prior taxation year in
respect of the disposition of the subject shares
multiplied by the amount determined by the for-
mula
E ÷ F
where
E
is the fraction of a capital gain that is a tax-
able capital gain under paragraph 38(a) in the
current year, and
F
is the fraction of a capital gain that is a tax-
able capital gain under paragraph 38(a) in the
prior year in respect of the disposition of the
subject shares.

Disqualifying event
(3) For the purposes of this section, a disqualifying event
in respect of a qualifying business transfer occurs at the
earliest of
(a) the time when the trust that participated in the
qualifying business transfer ceases to be an employee
ownership trust, and
(b) the time that is the beginning of the taxation year
of a qualifying business of the trust in which less than
50% of the fair market value of the shares of the quali-
fying business is attributable to assets used principally
in an active business carried on by one or more quali-
fying businesses controlled by the trust at both that
time and at the beginning of the preceding taxation
year of the qualifying business.
Consequences of a disqualifying event
(4) If a disqualifying event in respect of a qualifying busi-
ness transfer occurs
(a) within 24 months of the disposition time for the
qualifying business transfer, subsection (2) is deemed
to have never applied in respect of the subject shares
disposed of under the qualifying business transfer; or
(b) any time after the day that is 24 months after the
disposition time for the qualifying business transfer,
in computing the income of the trust that participated
in the qualifying business transfer, the trust is deemed
to have a gain equal to the elected amount (within the
meaning of clause (1)(e)(ii)(A)) included in the joint
election referred to in paragraph (1)(e), for the year in
which the disqualifying event occurs, from the disposi-
tion of a capital property.
Anti-avoidance
(5) Despite any other provision in this section, subsec-
tion (2) does not apply in respect of a qualifying business
transfer if it is reasonable to consider that one of the pur-
poses of any transaction (as defined in subsection
245(1)), or series of transactions, is to

(a) involve the trust (or the purchaser corporation) in
the qualifying business transfer to accommodate the
direct or indirect acquisition of subject shares (or the
acquisition of all or substantially all of the risk of loss
and opportunity for gain or profit in respect of the
subject shares) by another person or partnership (oth-
er than the trust or the purchaser corporation) in a
manner that permits an individual to claim a deduc-
tion under subsection (2) that would otherwise not be
available; or
(b) organize or reorganize a subject corporation or
any other corporation, partnership or trust in a man-
ner that allows a deduction to be claimed under sub-
section (2) in respect of more than one qualifying busi-
ness transfer of a business that is relevant to the deter-
mination of whether subject shares satisfied the condi-
tion set out in paragraph (a) of the definition qualify-
ing business transfer in subsection 248(1).
Failure to report capital gain
(6) Despite subsection (2), no amount may be deducted
under this section in respect of a capital gain of an indi-
vidual for a particular taxation year in computing the in-
dividual’s taxable income for the particular taxation year
or any subsequent year, if
(a) the individual knowingly or under circumstances
amounting to gross negligence
(i) fails to file the individual’s return of income for
the particular taxation year within one year after
the taxpayer’s filing-due date for the particular tax-
ation year, or
(ii) fails to report the capital gain in the individual’s
return of income for the particular taxation year;
and
(b) the Minister establishes the facts justifying the de-
nial of such an amount under this section.
Deduction not permitted
(7) Despite subsection (2), no amount may be deducted
under this section in computing an individual’s taxable
income for a taxation year in respect of a capital gain of
the individual for the taxation year if the capital gain is
from a disposition of property which disposition is part
of a series of transactions or events
(a) that includes a dividend received by a corporation
to which dividend subsection 55(2) does not apply but

would apply if this Act were read without reference to
paragraph 55(3)(b); or
(b) in which any property is acquired by a corporation
or partnership for consideration that is significantly
less than the fair market value of the property at the
time of acquisition (other than an acquisition as the
result of an amalgamation or merger of corporations
or the winding-up of a corporation or partnership or a
distribution of property of a trust in satisfaction of all
or part of a corporation’s capital interest in the trust).
Deduction not permitted
(8) Despite subsection (2), if an individual has a capital
gain for a taxation year from the disposition of a property
and it can reasonably be concluded, having regard to all
the circumstances, that a significant part of the capital
gain is attributable to the fact that dividends were not
paid on a share (other than a prescribed share within the
meaning of subsection 110.6(8)) or that dividends paid on
such a share in the taxation year or in any preceding tax-
ation year were less than 90% of the average annual rate
of return on that share for that year, no amount in re-
spect of that capital gain shall be deducted under this
section in computing the individual’s taxable income for
the year.
Average annual rate of return
(9) For the purpose of subsection (8), the average annual
rate of return on a share (other than a prescribed share
within the meaning of subsection 110.6(8)) of a corpora-
tion for a taxation year is the annual rate of return by way
of dividends that a knowledgeable and prudent investor
who purchased the share on the day it was issued would
expect to receive in that year, other than the first year af-
ter the issue, in respect of the share if
(a) there was no delay or postponement of the pay-
ment of dividends and no failure to pay dividends in
respect of the share;
(b) there was no variation from year to year in the
amount of dividends payable in respect of the share
(other than where the amount of dividends payable is
expressed as an invariant percentage of or by refer-
ence to an invariant difference between the dividend
expressed as a rate of interest and a generally quoted
market interest rate); and
(c) the proceeds to be received by the investor on the
disposition of the share are the same amount the cor-
poration received as consideration on the issue of the
share.

Deduction not permitted
(10) If it is reasonable to consider that one of the main
reasons for an individual acquiring, holding or having an
interest in a partnership or trust (other than an interest
in a personal trust) or for the existence of any terms, con-
ditions, rights or other attributes of the interest is to en-
able the individual to receive or have allocated to the in-
dividual a percentage of any capital gain or taxable capi-
tal gain of the partnership or trust that is larger than the
individual’s percentage of the income of the partnership
or trust, as the case may be, despite any other provision
of this Act, no amount may be deducted under subsection
(2) by the individual in respect of any such gain allocated
or distributed to the individual.
Related persons, etc.
(11) For the purposes of this section,
(a) a taxpayer shall be deemed to have disposed of
shares that are identical properties in the order in
which the taxpayer acquired them;
(b) a personal trust shall be deemed
(i) to be related to a person or partnership for any
period throughout which the person or partnership
was a beneficiary of the trust, and
(ii) in respect of shares of the capital stock of a cor-
poration, to be related to the person from whom it
acquired those shares if, at the time the trust dis-
posed of the shares, all of the beneficiaries (other
than registered charities) of the trust were related
to that person or would have been so related if that
person were living at that time;
(c) a partnership shall be deemed to be related to a
person for any period throughout which the person
was a member of the partnership;
(d) a person who is a member of a partnership that is
a member of another partnership is deemed to be a
member of the other partnership;
(e) if a corporation acquires shares of a class of the
capital stock of another corporation from any person,
it shall be deemed in respect of those shares to be re-
lated to the person if all or substantially all the consid-
eration received by that person from the corporation
in respect of those shares was common shares of the
capital stock of the corporation; and

son or partnership shall be deemed to have been

thereof shall be added in computing the clean hydrogen
tax credit of the taxpayer at the end of the particular year.
Unpaid amounts
(13) For the purposes of this section, where any part of
the capital cost of a taxpayer’s eligible clean hydrogen
property is unpaid on the day that is 180 days after the
end of the taxation year in which a deduction in respect
of a clean hydrogen tax credit would otherwise be avail-
able in respect of the property, such amount is to be
(a) excluded from the capital cost of the property in
the year; and
(b) added to the capital cost of the property at the
time it is paid.
Tax shelter investment
(14) Subsection (2) does not apply if an eligible clean hy-
drogen property – or an interest in a person or partner-
ship that has, directly or indirectly, an interest in, or for

fied verification firm in respect of the project; and
(e) any information required in guidelines published
by the Minister of Natural Resources, including the
Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credit – Validation
and Verification Guidance Document.
Failure to report

for a project as described in subsection (16) is liable to a
penalty, for each such failure, in an amount, not exceed-
ing the total of all clean hydrogen tax credits deducted by
the taxpayer in respect of the project, equal to the
amount determined by the formula
((4% × A) ÷ 365) × B
where
A
is the total of all amounts, each of which is the
amount of a clean hydrogen tax credit in respect of
the project deducted by the taxpayer for a taxation
year that ended before the applicable date in subsec-
tion (16); and

tinues.
Recovery — change in carbon intensity
(18) In the taxation year of a taxpayer in which the com-
pliance period of the taxpayer’s qualified clean hydrogen
project ends, if the average actual carbon intensity of the
hydrogen produced is greater than the most recent ex-
pected carbon intensity that was used to determine a
clean hydrogen tax credit in respect of the project, there
shall be added to the taxpayer’s tax otherwise payable
under this Part for the taxation year an amount equal to
the total of all amounts, each of which is determined by
the formula
(A − B) × C
where
A
is the specified percentage that was applied to the
capital cost of the eligible clean hydrogen property
forming part of the project in determining a clean
hydrogen tax credit of the taxpayer;
B
is the specified percentage that would have applied
to the capital cost of the property if the expected

hydrogen tax credit was deducted.
Minister’s determination
(19) For the purpose of subsection (18), the Minister of
Natural Resources shall review each of the taxpayer’s
compliance reports described in subsection (16) and the
Minister may, in consultation with the Minister of Natu-
ral Resources, make a determination or redetermination
of the actual carbon intensity of the hydrogen produced
by a taxpayer’s clean hydrogen project for any operating
year during the compliance period of the project.
De minimis exception
(20) Subsection (18) does not apply to a taxpayer if the
difference between the average actual carbon intensity of
the taxpayer’s qualified clean hydrogen project and the
expected carbon intensity of the project is 0.5 or less.
Recapture of clean hydrogen tax credit — application
(21) Subsection (22) applies in a taxation year if
(a) a taxpayer acquired an eligible clean hydrogen
property in the year or any of the preceding 20 calen-
dar years;
(b) the taxpayer became entitled to a clean hydrogen
tax credit in respect of the capital cost, or a portion of
the capital cost, of the property; and
(c) in the year, the property is converted to a non-hy-
drogen or ammonia use, is exported from Canada or is
disposed of without having been previously exported
or converted to a non-hydrogen or ammonia use.
Recapture of clean hydrogen tax credit

hydrogen project of the taxpayer to another taxable
Canadian corporation (referred to in this subsection as
the “purchaser”), and the vendor and the purchaser joint-
ly elect in prescribed form, on or before the day that is
the earliest of the days on or before which any taxpayer
making the election is required to file a return of income
pursuant to section 150 for the taxation year in which the
transaction occurred, to have this subsection apply, the
following rules apply:
(a) the purchaser is deemed to have acquired any eli-
gible clean hydrogen property of the vendor at the
times acquired by the vendor;
(b) the provisions of this Act that applied to the ven-
dor in respect of the property that are relevant to the
application of the Act in respect of the property after
that time are deemed to have applied to the purchaser
and, for greater certainty, the purchaser is deemed to
have claimed the clean hydrogen tax credits deter-
mined under subsection (2) that could have been
claimed by the vendor, before that time, in respect of
the project;
(c) any clean hydrogen project plans that were filed by
the vendor in respect of the project before that time
are deemed to have been filed by the purchaser;
(d) the purchaser is or will be liable for amounts in re-
spect of the property for which the vendor would be li-
able under this section in respect of actions, transac-
tions or events that occur after that time as if the

section 229 of the Income Tax Regulations to be filed in
respect of the fiscal period of the partnership.
Recovery and recapture — partnerships
(25) If subsection (12) has at any time applied to add an
amount in computing the clean hydrogen tax credit of a
member of a partnership, subsections (18) to (23) apply
to determine amounts in respect of the partnership as if
the partnership was a taxable Canadian corporation, its
fiscal period were its taxation year and it had deducted
all of the clean hydrogen tax credits that were previously
added in computing the clean hydrogen tax credit of any
member of the partnership because of the application of
subsection (12) in respect of its partnership interest.
Member’s share of recovery or recapture
(26) Unless subsection (27) applies, if, in a taxation year,
a taxpayer is a member of a partnership, the amount that
can reasonably be considered to be the taxpayer’s share
of any amount of tax determined because of subsection
(25) in respect of the partnership shall be added to the
taxpayer’s tax otherwise payable under this Part for the
year.
Election by member
(27) A taxable Canadian corporation that is a member of
a partnership during a fiscal period of the partnership
may elect, in prescribed form and manner, to add to its

(26); or
(b) of a taxable Canadian corporation because of sub-
section (27) and paid by the corporation by its filing-
due date for the year.
Interest on recovery tax
(29) For the purpose of applying subsection 161(1) to an
amount of tax payable because of subsection (18) (other
than an amount payable because of subsection (8)), the
balance-due day of a taxpayer is deemed to be the bal-
ance-due day of the taxation year for the related clean hy-
drogen tax credit under subsection (2).
Credit after compliance period
(30) For the purpose of applying subsection (2) in re-
spect of a property acquired after the compliance period
of a qualified clean hydrogen project of the taxpayer, the
expected carbon intensity of the project is deemed to be
the greater of the expected carbon intensity otherwise de-
termined and the average actual carbon intensity for the
compliance period of the project.
Purpose
(31) The purpose of this section is to encourage the in-
vestment of capital in the production of clean hydrogen
and clean ammonia in Canada.
Authority of the Minister of Natural Resources
(32) For the purpose of determining whether a property
is an eligible clean hydrogen property, the Clean Hydro-
gen Investment Tax Credit – Technical and Equipment
Guidance Document published by the Department of
Natural Resources is to apply conclusively with respect to
engineering and scientific matters.

the reporting currency of the consolidated financial state-
ments of the ultimate parent entity of the MNE group

course of preparing the consolidated financial state-
ments, that amount is to be converted to that reporting
currency using the foreign currency translation princi-

the reporting currency of the consolidated financial
statements of the ultimate parent entity of the MNE
group; and
(b) if that amount is not denominated in the reporting
currency, it is to be converted, for use in the determi-

more other groups or ungrouped entities, then for any
fiscal year preceding the particular fiscal year (referred to
in this subsection as the “preceding year”)
(a) all amounts that are the revenue or a portion of
the revenue reported in the consolidated financial
statements of the ultimate parent entity of any of
those groups or in the financial statements of any of
those ungrouped entities, as the case may be, and that
correspond to any period included in the preceding
year (with the revenue apportioned between periods,
if necessary, on a just and reasonable basis) are to be
aggregated; and
(b) the aggregate amount determined under para-
graph (a) is deemed to be the revenue reported in the
consolidated financial statements of the ultimate par-
ent entity of the MNE group for the preceding year.
Qualifying MNE group — demerger
(4) If there is a demerger of an MNE group that was a
qualifying MNE group in the fiscal year immediately pre-
ceding the fiscal year in which the demerger occurs and
any of the groups resulting from the demerger is an MNE
group (referred to in this subsection as a “demerged
MNE group”), the condition in paragraph (a) of the defi-
nition qualifying MNE group in subsection (1) is
deemed to be satisfied in respect of the demerged MNE
group for

(a) the first fiscal year of the demerged MNE group
ending after the demerger occurs (referred to in this
paragraph as the “first post-demerger year”), if the
revenue reported in the consolidated financial state-
ments of the ultimate parent entity of the demerged
MNE group for the first post-demerger year is greater

consolidated financial statements of the ultimate par-
ent entity of the demerged MNE group for at least two
out of the tested year and any other fiscal years of the
demerged MNE group ending before the tested year

is the number of days in the post-demerger year.
Merger — meaning
(5) For the purposes of subsection (3), a merger is any
arrangement under which
(a) all or substantially all of the entities of two or more

those entities form a single group immediately follow-
ing the conclusion of the arrangement; or
(b) one or more entities that are not included in any
group are brought under common control with anoth-
er entity, or one or more groups of entities, such that
all those entities form a single group immediately fol-
lowing the conclusion of the arrangement.

Top-up tax payable
15 (1) The amount of the tax a person must pay in re-
spect of an MNE group for a fiscal year is equal to the to-
tal of all amounts, each of which is an amount deter-
mined by the formula
A − B

fiscal year that is included in both
(a) the amount determined for A for the fiscal
year, and
(b) the allocable share, of the top-up amount of
the constituent entity for the fiscal year, of a rele-
vant parent entity of the MNE group through
which the person referred to in paragraph (a), or
the relevant parent entity referred to in paragraph
(b), of the description of A indirectly holds an
ownership interest in the constituent entity.
Definition of allocable share

constituent entity of an MNE group for a fiscal year,
means the ratio determined by the formula
(A − B) ÷ A
where

interests other than ownership interests held directly
or indirectly by the relevant parent entity, under the
principles of the financial accounting standard appli-
cable in preparing the consolidated financial state-
ments of the ultimate parent entity of the MNE
group for the fiscal year, if the net income of the con-
stituent entity were equal to its GloBE income and on
the assumption that
(a) the relevant parent entity had prepared con-
solidated financial statements (referred to in this
subsection as “hypothetical consolidated financial
statements”) in accordance with that financial ac-
counting standard,
(b) the relevant parent entity had a controlling in-
terest in the constituent entity such that all of the
income and expenses of the constituent entity
were consolidated on a line-by-line basis with
those of the relevant parent entity in the hypothet-
ical consolidated financial statements,

(a) for a constituent entity other than a permanent es-
tablishment, the net income or loss determined for
that constituent entity
(i) in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the ultimate parent entity of the MNE
group that includes the constituent entity, or
(ii) under another acceptable financial accounting
standard or authorized financial accounting stan-
dard, if
(A) it is not reasonably practicable to determine
the financial accounting income for the con-
stituent entity based on the accounting standard
used in the preparation of the consolidated fi-
nancial statements of the ultimate parent entity,
(B) the financial accounts of the constituent en-
tity are maintained based on the other accept-
able financial accounting standard or authorized
financial accounting standard,
(C) the information in those financial accounts
is reliable, such that an auditor applying the gen-
erally accepted auditing standards of the juris-
diction in which the ultimate parent entity or
constituent entity is located (or, in the case of a
flow-through entity, the jurisdiction in which the
entity was created) would reasonably conclude
that the constituent entity has in place processes
and controls that are likely to ensure that the in-
formation in the financial accounts is fair and ac-
curate, and
(D) that amount is adjusted to eliminate any
permanent difference greater than €1 million
that arises for the fiscal year because the other fi-
nancial accounting standard is used instead of
the financial accounting standard of the ultimate
parent entity; and
(b) for a constituent entity that is a permanent estab-
lishment,
(i) if the permanent establishment is described in
any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of the definition per-
manent establishment in subsection 2(1), the
amount that
(A) is the net income or loss reflected in the sep-
arate financial accounts of the permanent estab-
lishment, if those financial accounts are pre-
pared in accordance with an acceptable financial
accounting standard or in accordance with an
authorized financial accounting standard and

competitive distortions, or
(B) if the permanent establishment does not
have separate financial accounts described in
clause (A), would be the net income or loss of
that permanent establishment reflected in sepa-
rate financial accounts prepared on a stand-
alone basis in accordance with the accounting
standard used in the preparation of the ultimate
parent entity’s consolidated financial statements,
and
(ii) if the constituent entity is a permanent estab-
lishment described in paragraph (d) of the defini-
tion permanent establishment in subsection 2(1),
the net income or loss determined on the assump-
tion that
(A) the only income of the permanent establish-
ment is its income that is exempted from tax in
the jurisdiction where the main entity in respect
of the permanent establishment is located and
that is attributable to activities carried on out-
side the jurisdiction in which the main entity is
located, and
(B) the only expenses of the permanent estab-
lishment are its expenses that are attributable to
the activities described in clause (A) and are not
deducted for tax purposes in the jurisdiction in
which the main entity is located.
Permanent establishments — adjustment
(2) The amount that would, in the absence of this sub-
section, be a permanent establishment’s financial ac-
counting income is adjusted to reflect only the amounts
of income and expense that are — or, if paragraph (c) ap-
plies, would be — attributable to the permanent estab-
lishment (regardless of whether such amount is subject
to tax or deductible, as the case may be, in the jurisdic-
tion in which the permanent establishment is located) in
accordance with

tablishment in subsection 2(1) applies, the tax treaty
applicable to the permanent establishment;
(b) if paragraph (b) of that definition applies, the law
of the jurisdiction in which the permanent establish-
ment is located; or

come or loss of a permanent establishment (other than
any portion of that amount that is excluded from the fi-
nancial accounting income of the permanent establish-
ment because of subsection (2)) is not to be taken into ac-
count in determining the GloBE income or loss of the
main entity in respect of the permanent establishment.
No consolidation adjustments
(4) The financial accounting income of a constituent en-
tity is to include income, expenses, gains and losses (oth-
er than amounts excluded from GloBE income or loss be-
cause of subsection (5)) arising from transactions be-
tween the constituent entity and any other group entity,
other than any transactions to which an election under
subsection 18(24) applies.
Profit and loss statement — general rule
(5) Unless otherwise required under this Act, no amount
is included in computing the GloBE income or loss of a
constituent entity if it is recognized outside of the profit
and loss statement of the constituent entity’s financial
statements.
Financial accounting income — flow-through entity
(6) If a constituent entity is a particular flow-through en-
tity, the following rules apply in determining the finan-
cial accounting income for a fiscal year of the particular
flow-through entity and any other group entities in re-
spect of the net income or loss of the particular flow-
through entity:
(a) amounts in respect of the particular flow-through
entity’s net income or loss that are attributable to
ownership interests of persons or entities that are not
group entities and that hold their ownership interests
in the particular flow-through entity directly, or
through a tax transparent structure, are not to be in-
cluded in computing the financial accounting income
of any group entity, unless
(i) the particular flow-through entity is an ultimate
parent entity, or
(ii) the particular flow-through entity is owned, di-
rectly or through a tax transparent structure, by an
ultimate parent entity that is also a flow-through
entity, in which case this paragraph does not apply
to amounts in respect of the particular flow-
through entity’s net income or loss to the extent
those amounts are attributable to persons or enti-
ties that hold their ownership interests in the par-
ticular flow-through entity through that ultimate
parent entity;

(each referred to in this clause as an “intermedi-
ate owner”), if

quisition of ownership interests in that entity by an exist-
ing group entity, unless

and
(b) it is not reasonably practicable to determine the

Prior period errors and changes in accounting
principles
(11) If there has been a change in the opening equity of a
constituent entity at the start of a fiscal year, the con-
stituent entity’s GloBE income or loss for the fiscal year
includes the amount of that change if the change is at-
tributable to
(a) a correction of an error in the accounts for a previ-
ous fiscal year that affected the income or expenses in-
cluded in the computation of GloBE income or loss for
that year, except to the extent the correction of that er-
ror resulted in a material decrease in a liability for
covered taxes subject to paragraph 27(1)(b); or
(b) a change in accounting principle or policy that af-
fects income or expenses included in the computation
of GloBE income or loss.
Pension expense

Arm’s length requirement — certain transactions
(13) GloBE income or loss of a particular constituent en-
tity of an MNE group for a fiscal year is to be adjusted to
ensure that a transaction is reflected in accordance with

(b) either
(i) the recorded value of the transaction is not the
same in each of the constituent entities’ financial
accounts, or
(ii) the transaction is not recorded, in the particular
constituent entity’s financial accounts, in accor-
dance with the arm’s length principle; and
(c) where subparagraph (b)(ii) applies, any of the fol-
lowing conditions is met:

owned constituent entity,
(ii) only one of the constituent entities is an invest-
ment entity or insurance investment entity,

puting the GloBE income or loss of one of the con-
stituent entities for the fiscal year.
Arm’s length requirement — accounting and tax
(14) If a transaction between two or more constituent
entities of an MNE group (referred to in this subsection
as the “counterparties”) that are not located in the same
jurisdiction is not recorded in the same amount, not
recorded in accordance with the arm’s length principle or
not recorded at all in the financial accounts of the coun-
terparties for a fiscal year
(a) the GloBE income or loss of each of the counter-
parties is to be adjusted to reflect the amount deter-
mined in respect of the transaction in computing the
counterparties’ incomes for tax purposes, if
(i) as a result of transfer pricing adjustments, a dif-
ference between the treatment of an amount for tax
purposes and for accounting purposes that is not
eliminated over time and does not give rise to de-
ferred tax (referred to in this subsection as a “per-
manent difference”) arises for each counterparty in
respect of the transaction, and
(ii) the permanent difference for each counterparty
corresponds to the permanent difference for the
other counterparty; or
(b) the GloBE income or loss of each of the counter-
parties is to be adjusted to reflect the amount deter-
mined, as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment, in
respect of the transaction in computing the income for

tax purposes of one of the counterparties (referred to
in this paragraph as the “high-tax entity”), if
(i) as a result of the transfer pricing adjustment, a
permanent difference arises for the high-tax entity
in respect of the transaction but does not arise for
the other counterparty, and
(ii) the following conditions are met:
(A) the nominal tax rate that applies to the high-
tax entity equals or exceeds the minimum rate,
and
(B) the effective tax rate of the MNE group for
the jurisdiction equals or exceeds the minimum
rate in at least one of the two fiscal years imme-
diately preceding the fiscal year.
Qualified refundable tax credits
(15) In computing the GloBE income or loss of a con-
stituent entity for a fiscal year, a qualified refundable tax
credit is treated as income as follows:
(a) if the tax credit is related to the acquisition or con-
struction of assets and the originator has an account-
ing policy of reducing the carrying value of its assets in
respect of such tax credits or recognizing the tax credit
as deferred income, the originator must follow the ac-
counting policy; and
(b) in any other case, the face value of the tax credit is
treated as income in the fiscal year in which the enti-
tlement under the tax credit accrues.
Marketable transferable tax credits
(16) In computing the GloBE income or loss of a con-
stituent entity for a fiscal year,
(a) if the constituent entity is an originator of a mar-
ketable transferable tax credit, the face value of the tax
credit is treated as income in the origination year, sub-
ject to the following rules:
(i) if the tax credit is transferred within 15 months
of the end of the origination year, the purchase
price (and not the face value) of the tax credit is
treated as income in the origination year,

PART 2 Global Minimum Tax Act
Enactment of Act

(ii) if the tax credit is related to the acquisition or
construction of assets and the originator has an ac-
counting policy of reducing the carrying value of its
assets in respect of such tax credits, or recognizing
the tax credit as deferred income, the originator
must follow this same accounting policy,
(iii) if the tax credit is transferred more than 15
months after the end of the origination year,
(A) if the tax credit is described in subparagraph
(ii), the amount by which the face value of the
tax credit that was included in GloBE income or
loss under that subparagraph exceeds the pur-
chase price of the tax credit is treated as a loss on
a pro rata basis over the remaining productive
life of the asset, and
(B) in any other case, the amount by which the
face value of the tax credit that was included in
GloBE income or loss in the origination year ex-
ceeds the purchase price of the tax credit is treat-
ed as a loss in the fiscal year of the transfer, and
(iv) if all or a portion of the tax credit expires with-
out use, the face value attributable to the expired
portion of the tax credit is treated as a loss or in-
crease to the carrying value of the asset, as the case
may be, in the fiscal year of the expiration; and
(b) if the constituent entity is an unrelated purchaser
of a marketable transferable tax credit, the following
rules apply:
(i) if all or a portion of the tax credit is used by the
unrelated purchaser to satisfy its liability for a cov-
ered tax, the amount by which the face value of the
tax credit exceeds the purchase price is treated as
income in the fiscal year in which, and in the pro-
portion to which, the amount of the tax credit is
used by the unrelated purchaser to satisfy its liabili-
ty for a covered tax,
(ii) if the tax credit is transferred by the unrelated
purchaser to another unrelated purchaser, the total
of the sale price and any amount of the credit that
has been used, minus the total of the purchase price
and any gain recognized from use of the tax credit
under subparagraph (i), is treated as income or
loss, as the case may be, of the unrelated purchaser
in the fiscal year of the transfer, and
(iii) if the tax credit expires without use, the
amount by which the total of the purchase price
and any gain recognized from use of the tax credit
under subparagraph (i) exceeds the amount of the

tax credit used is treated as a loss in the fiscal year
of the expiration.
Other tax credits
(17) In computing the GloBE income or loss of a con-
stituent entity for a fiscal year, the face value of a tax
credit (other than a qualified refundable tax credit or a
marketable transferable tax credit) is not treated as in-
come.
Anti-avoidance — intragroup financing arrangements
(18) GloBE income or loss of a constituent entity that is
a low-tax entity for a fiscal year excludes any expense
that is attributable to an intragroup financing arrange-
ment that can reasonably be expected, over the duration
of the arrangement,
(a) to increase the amount of expenses taken into ac-
count in computing the GloBE income or loss of the
low-tax entity; and
(b) not to result in a corresponding increase in the in-
come for tax purposes of a high-tax counterparty for
the fiscal year, including because an amount received
or receivable in respect of the arrangement by the
high-tax counterparty can reasonably be considered to
be eligible for an exclusion, exemption, deduction,
credit or other tax benefit under local law where the
amount of that benefit is calculated by reference to the
amount of payment received.
Insurance companies
(19) If a constituent entity is an insurance company, the
constituent entity’s GloBE income or loss for a fiscal year
(a) excludes any amount that is
(i) included in the constituent entity’s financial ac-
counting income for the fiscal year, and
(ii) in respect of a charge to policyholders for taxes
paid by the constituent entity in respect of returns
to the policyholders, to the extent an amount is in-
cluded in computing the constituent entity’s GloBE
income or loss under paragraph (1)(e); and
(b) includes returns to policyholders that are not re-
flected in the constituent entity’s financial accounting
income for the fiscal year, to the extent that a corre-
sponding increase or decrease in liability to policy-
holders is reflected in its financial accounting income.

Qualifying tier one capital
(20) In computing the GloBE income or loss of a con-
stituent entity for a fiscal year,
(a) if an amount is recognized as a decrease to the eq-
uity of the constituent entity attributable to a distribu-
tion paid or payable in respect of qualifying tier one
capital issued by the constituent entity, the amount is
treated as an expense; and
(b) if an amount is recognized as an increase to the
equity of the constituent entity attributable to distri-
butions received or receivable in respect of qualifying
tier one capital held by the constituent entity, the
amount is treated as income.
Stock-based compensation expense — election
(21) If a filing constituent entity elects under this sub-
section, in respect of the costs or expenses of the group
entities that are located in a jurisdiction that were paid
with stock-based compensation (each referred to in this
subsection as a “stock-based compensation expense”),
the following rules apply:
(a) the election is a five-year election;
(b) in computing the GloBE income or loss of each
group entity that is located in that jurisdiction for a
fiscal year to which the election applies, the amount
allowed as a deduction in respect of any stock-based
compensation expense in computing that entity’s in-
come for tax purposes under the law of that jurisdic-
tion for a local taxation year ending in the fiscal year is
to be substituted for the amount of that stock-based
compensation expense reflected as an expense in that
entity’s financial accounting income for that fiscal
year;
(c) in computing the GloBE income or loss of each
group entity that is located in that jurisdiction for any
fiscal year to which the election applies, the group en-
tity is to include as income an amount equal to the to-
tal of all amounts, each of which is a stock-based com-
pensation expense that
(i) arose in respect of an option that expires with-
out exercise in the fiscal year, and

compensation expenses arising from a transaction,
and any amount in respect of the stock-based compen-
sation expenses arising from that transaction was re-
flected in the financial accounting income of a group
entity for a fiscal year preceding the first fiscal year to
which the election applies, in computing GloBE in-
come or loss of that group entity for that first fiscal
year, the amount determined by the following formula
is to be included as income:
A − B
where
A
is the total of all amounts, each of which is an
amount in respect of stock-based compensation
expenses arising from that transaction that was al-
lowed as an expense in computing the group enti-
ty’s GloBE income or loss for a fiscal year preced-
ing the first fiscal year, and
B
is the total of all amounts, each of which is the
amount in respect of those stock-based compensa-
tion expenses that would have been allowed as an
expense in computing the GloBE income or loss of
the group entity for a fiscal year preceding the
first fiscal year, if the election had applied to that
preceding fiscal year; and
(e) if the election is revoked, and any options in re-
spect of any stock-based compensation to which the
election applied have not been exercised — and the ex-
ercise period has not yet ended — before the revoca-
tion year, in computing GloBE income or loss of a
group entity that is located in the jurisdiction for the
revocation year, the amount determined by the follow-
ing formula is to be included as income:
A − B
where
A
is the total of all amounts, each of which is an
amount in respect of that stock-based compensa-
tion expense allowed as an expense in computing
the GloBE income or loss of the group entity in ac-

ing the revocation year, and

is the total of all amounts, each of which is the
amount in respect of that stock-based compensa-
tion that accrued as an expense in the group enti-
ty’s financial accounts, and would have been al-

Fair value and impairment accounting — election
(22) If a filing constituent entity elects under this sub-
section, in respect of a jurisdiction, to determine gains
and losses using the realization principle for the purpose
of computing GloBE income or loss for a fiscal year, the
following rules apply:
(a) the election is a five-year election;
(b) the election applies to
(i) all entities that are
(A) if the filing constituent entity specifies in the
election that it is to apply only to investment en-
tities, group entities that are investment entities
that are located in the jurisdiction, and
(B) in any other case, group entities that are lo-
cated in the jurisdiction, and
(ii) all assets and, if clause (B) applies, all liabilities
that are
(A) if the filing constituent entity specifies in the
election that it is to apply only to tangible assets,
tangible assets subject to fair value accounting or
impairment accounting, and
(B) in any other case, assets and liabilities sub-
ject to fair value accounting or impairment ac-
counting;
(c) if the election applies to a constituent entity for a
fiscal year,
(i) gains or losses attributable to fair value or im-
pairment accounting with respect to assets or liabil-
ities to which the election applies are excluded in
computing GloBE income or loss of the constituent
entity for the fiscal year, and

election, the carrying value of the asset or liability is
its carrying value at the later of
(A) the beginning of the first fiscal year to which
the election applies, and
(B) the date on which the asset was acquired or
the liability was incurred; and
(d) if the election is revoked and a constituent entity
to which the election applied holds an asset or liability
to which the election applied at the beginning of the
revocation year, the constituent entity’s GloBE income
or loss for the revocation year includes the positive or
negative amount determined by the formula
A − B
where
A
is the fair value of the asset or liability at the be-
ginning of the revocation year, and
B
is the carrying value of the asset or liability as de-

Aggregate asset gain — election
(23) If the filing constituent entity elects under this sub-
section in respect of the aggregate asset gain for a fiscal
year (referred to in this subsection as the “election year”)
of the constituent entities of the MNE group that are lo-
cated in a particular jurisdiction (each referred to in this
subsection as a “local entity”), the following rules apply:
(a) covered taxes with respect to any net asset gain or
net asset loss of a local entity in the election year are
to be excluded in computing adjusted covered taxes;
(b) GloBE income or loss of local entities for the elec-
tion year
(i) excludes any amounts allocated to local entities
under paragraph (d) or (e) (other than any amount
allocated to the election year under paragraph (e)),
and
(ii) includes any amounts allocated to the election
year under paragraph (e);
(c) for the purposes of subsection 31(1), GloBE in-
come or loss, of a local entity for a fiscal year, is ad-
justed as follows:
(i) an amount allocated to a local entity under para-
graph (d) for a fiscal year reduces the entity’s net
asset loss for that year, and

(ii) an amount allocated to a local entity under
paragraph (e) for a fiscal year is included as income
for that year;
(d) amounts in respect of the aggregate asset gain are
carried back to loss years within the look-back period,
in order from the earliest loss year to the latest loss
year, and allocated to the local entities for those loss
years, with the amount allocated to any particular lo-
cal entity for any particular loss year being determined
by the formula
A × B ÷ C
where
A
is the lesser of
(i) the aggregate asset loss of local entities for
the particular loss year, less the total of the
amounts, if any, already allocated to those enti-
ties for that particular year under this para-
graph because of a previous election under this
subsection, and
(ii) the aggregate asset gain, less the total of the
amounts, if any, allocated in respect of that
gain under this paragraph to local entities for a
preceding loss year,
B
is the particular local entity’s net asset loss for the
particular loss year, and
C
is the total of all amounts, each of which is the net
asset loss of a local entity for the particular loss
year; and
(e) if any amount of the aggregate asset gain remains
after reducing it by the total of the amounts in respect
of the aggregate asset gain allocated to local entities
under paragraph (d), that remainder is allocated even-
ly to each fiscal year in the look-back period (each re-
ferred to in this paragraph as a “look-back year”), with
the amount that is allocated to a particular local entity
for a particular look-back year being determined by
the formula
A ÷ 5 × B ÷ C
where
A
is the aggregate asset gain, less the total of the
amounts in respect of that aggregate asset gain al-
located to local entities under paragraph (d),
B
is

counting treatment of the ultimate parent entity to
eliminate income, expenses, gains and losses arising
from transactions between relevant local entities;
(b) the election is a five-year election;
(c) the financial accounting income of the relevant lo-

which the election has effect to ensure that there are
no duplications or omissions of items of income, ex-
penses, gains or losses arising as a result of electing
under this subsection;
(d) if an election under this subsection is revoked, the
financial accounting income of relevant local entities
is to be adjusted for the revocation year to ensure that

is a permanent establishment would, in the absence of
this subsection, have a GloBE loss (referred to in this
subsection as the “loss amount”) for a fiscal year
(a) that loss amount is to be treated as an expense of
the main entity in respect of the permanent establish-
ment (and not of the permanent establishment) in
computing its GloBE income or loss for the fiscal year,
to the extent that the loss amount
(i) is treated as an expense for the purposes of the
computation of tax in the jurisdiction in which the
main entity is located, and
(ii) is not set off against an item of income that is
subject to tax under the laws of both the jurisdic-
tion of the permanent establishment and of the
main entity; and
(b) if the permanent establishment would, in the ab-
sence of this subsection, have GloBE income (referred
to in this paragraph as the “income amount”) for a
subsequent fiscal year, that income amount is treated
as GloBE income of the main entity (and not of the
permanent establishment) to the extent of the lesser of
(i) the income amount of the permanent establish-
ment for the subsequent fiscal year, and
(ii) the amount, if any, by which the loss amount
described in paragraph (a) exceeds the total of all
amounts, each of which is, in respect of that loss
amount, an amount that was treated as GloBE in-
come of the main entity (and not of the permanent
establishment) in a prior fiscal year under this
paragraph.

Permanent establishment loss
(2) If subsection 18(26) applies in respect of a permanent
establishment and the main entity in respect of the per-
manent establishment, the following rules apply:
(a) a deferred tax expense in respect of a deferred tax
asset is excluded in computing the adjusted covered
taxes of the permanent establishment and the main
entity if
(i) the deferred tax asset is attributable to a tax loss
arising in the jurisdiction in which the permanent
establishment is located, and
(ii) the loss is treated as an expense of the main en-
tity under paragraph 18(26)(a); and
(b) if covered taxes arise in the jurisdiction in which
the permanent establishment is located in respect of
income (referred to in this paragraph as the “allocated
income”) of the permanent establishment that is in-
cluded in computing the GloBE income or loss of the
main entity for a fiscal year under paragraph
18(26)(b), the covered taxes are allocated from the
permanent establishment to the main entity for the
fiscal year, to the extent of the lesser of
(i) the amount of the covered taxes, and
(ii) the amount determined by the formula

Allocation — tax transparent entities
(3) An amount in respect of covered taxes is allocated
from a tax transparent entity to its constituent entity-
owner, to the extent that

interest in the tax transparent entity; and
(b) the amount is
(i) recorded in the financial accounts of the tax
transparent entity, and

Allocation — controlled foreign companies
(4) The following rules apply for the purposes of allocat-

as the “controlled foreign company”) of an MNE group,
amounts in respect of covered taxes to which a con-
stituent entity-owner of the controlled foreign company
is subject under a controlled foreign company tax regime:
(a) subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), an amount in re-

ed from the constituent entity-owner to the controlled
foreign company, if
(i) the constituent entity-owner is located in one ju-
risdiction (referred to in this paragraph as the “par-

ny is located in another jurisdiction (referred to in
this subsection as the “subsidiary jurisdiction”),
and
(ii) the amount is
(A) recorded in the financial accounts of the
constituent entity-owner for the fiscal year, and
(B) in respect of covered taxes, imposed under a
controlled foreign company tax regime of the
parent jurisdiction, applicable in respect of the
constituent entity-owner’s share of the con-

covered taxes imposed under a blended controlled for-
eign company tax regime that are recorded in the fi-
nancial accounts of a constituent entity-owner for a
fiscal year that is a transitional special allocation year,
the amount in respect of the covered taxes applicable
in respect of the constituent entity-owner’s share of
the controlled foreign company’s income for the fiscal
year is deemed to be equal to the amount determined
by the formula

(a) subject to paragraph (b), an amount in respect of
covered taxes (referred to in this subsection as the
“covered taxes amount”) recorded in the financial ac-
counts of the constituent entity-owner for a fiscal year
is allocated from the constituent entity-owner to the
hybrid entity to the extent the covered taxes are in re-

spect of passive income of the hybrid entity, the
amount to be allocated from the constituent entity-
owner to the hybrid entity under paragraph (a), in re-
spect of the portion of the covered taxes that are in re-
spect of the hybrid entity’s passive income, is not to
exceed the lesser of
(i) the portion of the covered taxes amount that is
in respect of the hybrid entity’s passive income, and

Amount
Definition of total deferred tax adjustment amount
25 (1) The total deferred tax adjustment amount, of
a constituent entity for a fiscal year, means the positive
or negative amount determined by the formula
A + B − C
where
A
is
(a) if the tax rate applicable in determining the
constituent entity’s deferred tax expense, in re-
spect of covered taxes, recorded in its financial ac-
counts for the year exceeds the minimum rate, the
amount that would be the constituent entity’s de-
ferred tax expense in respect of covered taxes
(subject to the exclusions under subsection (2)), if
the applicable tax rate were the minimum rate,
and
(b) in any other case, the constituent entity’s de-
ferred tax expense, in respect of covered taxes,
recorded in its financial accounts for the year
(subject to the exclusions under subsection (2));
B
is the total of all amounts each of which is
(a) an amount paid in the year in respect of an
unclaimed accrual of the constituent entity, or
(b) the amount of any recaptured deferred tax lia-
bility determined for a preceding fiscal year that
reverses in the year; and
C
is the total of all amounts each of which is
(a) a reduction to the amount determined for A
that would have occurred due to the recognition of

(b) to the extent not reflected as a reduction in de-
termining the amount for A, the amount by which
a deferred tax asset has increased because of sub-
section (5).
Total deferred tax adjustment amount — exclusions
(2) In determining the amount for A in subsection (1),
the following are to be excluded:
(a) the portion of deferred tax expense that is in re-
spect of
(i) an item that is not included in computing GloBE
income or loss,
(ii) a disallowed accrual or an unclaimed accrual, or
(iii) the generation or use of a tax credit;
(b) the effect of any valuation adjustment or account-
ing recognition adjustment in respect of a deferred tax
asset; and
(c) the portion of deferred tax expense that arises be-
cause of a re-measurement with respect to a change in
the rate of tax applicable in determining the deferred
tax expense.
Foreign tax credits — substitute loss carry-forward
(3) Despite subparagraph (2)(a)(iii), deferred tax ex-
pense must be included in determining the amount for A
in subsection (1) if it is in respect of a deferred tax asset
in respect of
(a) a substitute loss carry-forward tax credit, except
that, in a fiscal year in which the substitute loss carry-
forward tax credit is used, the deferred tax expense is
to be included only to the extent the substitute loss
carry-forward tax credit is used to reduce or eliminate
covered taxes in respect of income that is included in

Substitute loss carry-forward recapture amount
(4) To the extent it would not otherwise arise or reverse,
as the case may be, a deferred tax asset is deemed, in re-
spect of a substitute loss carry-forward recapture amount
of a constituent entity that is located in a particular juris-
diction, to
(a) arise in the fiscal year that the substitute loss car-
ry-forward recapture amount arises, in an amount
equal to the product obtained by multiplying the sub-
stitute loss carry-forward recapture amount by the
statutory tax rate applicable to the constituent entity
in the fiscal year under the income tax laws of the par-
ticular jurisdiction; and
(b) reverse, in any fiscal year (referred to in this para-
graph as a “recharacterization year”) in which a
recharacterization of income (referred to in this para-
graph as the “recharacterized income”) described in
paragraph (b) of the definition substitute loss carry-
forward recapture amount in subsection 2(1) occurs,
in an amount equal to the tax credits used by the con-
stituent entity solely as a result of the recharacteriza-
tion of income in the recharacterization year, to the
extent that
(i) the tax credits arise under the income tax laws
of the particular jurisdiction in respect of tax paid
to the government of a jurisdiction other than the
particular jurisdiction,
(ii) the amount of the recharacterized income in the
recharacterization year, together with the total
amounts of recharacterized income in the preced-
ing fiscal years, does not exceed the substitute loss
carry-forward recapture amount, and
(iii) the tax credits are used to reduce or eliminate
covered taxes that would otherwise be owing by the
constituent entity under the income tax laws of the
particular jurisdiction in respect of any amount of
income that is included in computing the con-
stituent entity’s GloBE income or loss.

flect the decrease in the liability,
(ii) the particular constituent entity’s GloBE in-
come or loss for the prior year is to be adjusted to
the extent
(A) the decrease in the liability results from a re-

GloBE income or an increase in its GloBE loss
for the prior year, and
(B) it is necessary to ensure there is no reduction
in the MNE group’s effective tax rate (deter-

constituent entity is located, for the prior year,
and
(iii) the GloBE income or loss, of the particular

for the prior year, the particular constituent entity is
deemed to have a deferred tax asset that
(i) arises in the current year,

taxes, recorded in the financial accounts, for the prior
year to the extent that
(i) the change results from an increase, in the par-

in determining the deferred tax expense for the pri-
or year — from a rate that was less than the mini-
mum rate, and
(ii) the deferred tax expense was reflected in deter-

increase of the rate of tax in excess of the minimum
rate is to be disregarded in determining the adjust-

SUBDIVISION G
Top-up Amount of an Investment
Entity
Definitions
36 (1) The following definitions apply in this section.
investment entity adjusted covered taxes amount
means the amount that would, in the absence of section
8, be determined in respect of an investment subgroup
entity for a fiscal year by the formula
A − (B × A)
where
A
is the amount of adjusted covered taxes of the invest-
ment subgroup entity for the fiscal year; and
B
is the minority investor percentage of the investment
subgroup entity for the fiscal year. (montant des
impôts concernés ajustés de l’entité d’investisse-
ment)
investment entity GloBE income amount means the
amount that would, in the absence of section 8, be deter-
mined in respect of an investment subgroup entity for a
fiscal year by the formula
A − (B × A)
where
A
is the GloBE income or loss of the investment sub-
group entity for the fiscal year; and
B
is the minority investor percentage of the investment
subgroup entity for the fiscal year. (montant du re-
venu GloBE de l’entité d’investissement)
investment subgroup, in respect of an MNE group,
means all investment subgroup entities of the MNE
group. (sous-groupe d’investissement)
investment subgroup entity, of an MNE group, means
a constituent entity of the MNE group that is an invest-
ment entity or an insurance investment entity. (entité
de sous-groupe d’investissement)
minority investor percentage, of an investment sub-
group entity for a fiscal year, means the percentage of the
GloBE income or loss of the investment subgroup entity
for the fiscal year that is attributable (based on the rele-
vant assumptions) to any ownership interest in the in-
vestment subgroup entity, other than any ownership in-
terest held, directly or indirectly, by the ultimate parent
entity of the MNE group of which the investment sub-
group entity is a constituent entity. (pourcentage de

minority-owned investment entity, of a minority-
owned subgroup of an MNE group, means a constituent
entity of the MNE group that is

minority-owned investment subgroup, in respect of a
minority-owned subgroup, means all minority-owned in-
vestment entities of the minority-owned subgroup.
(sous-groupe d’investissement à détention minori-

relevant assumptions, in respect of an attribution of
GloBE income or loss for a fiscal year to an ownership in-
terest in an investment subgroup entity, means the as-
sumptions that
(a) the principles of the authorized financial account-
ing standard applicable in the preparation of the con-
solidated financial statements for the fiscal year of the
ultimate parent entity of the MNE group that includes
the investment subgroup entity are used for the pur-
poses of the attribution;
(b) the net income of the investment subgroup entity
is equal to its GloBE income or loss; and
(c) no amount of the GloBE income or loss of the in-
vestment subgroup entity is attributable to transac-
tions with other group entities of the MNE group.

Investment subgroup entity — top-up amount
(2) Subject to subparagraphs 42(2)(d)(ii) and (e)(ii), the
top-up amount of an investment subgroup entity of an
investment subgroup in respect of an MNE group for a
fiscal year is the amount determined under subsection
30(1) applying the following rules:
(a) any references in sections 29 to 32 and 34 to
(i) “MNE group”, except the reference to that term
in the expression “ultimate parent entity of the
MNE group” in subsection 32(15) which is to be

to that term in subsection 31(1), paragraph 32(3)(e)
and subparagraph 32(14)(d)(iii), are to be read as
references to “investment entity GloBE income

nority-owned investment entity”;
(b) for greater certainty, all other amounts that are to
be determined under sections 29 to 32 and 34 in deter-
mining the top-up amount of an investment subgroup
entity of an investment subgroup are also to be deter-
mined applying the rules in paragraph (a);
(c) the amounts that would, in the absence of this
paragraph, be determined for A and B in the formula
in subsection 32(1) in respect of the investment sub-
group entity are to be multiplied by the ratio deter-

year” in sections 29 to 32 and 34 are to the fiscal year
of the MNE group; and
(e) any other modifications are made to sections 29 to

Interpretation rule
(3) For the purposes of determining the top-up amount
of an investment subgroup entity under subsection (2),
subsection 21(3) and sections 37 to 39, 41 and 42 apply
with such modifications, if any, as the context requires.
Allocation of investment subgroup entity top-up
amount
(4) For the purposes of Division 1, the GloBE income of
an investment subgroup entity of an investment sub-
group that is located in a jurisdiction for a fiscal year, is
(a) if the net GloBE income of the investment sub-
group for the jurisdiction for the fiscal year, as com-
puted in determining the top-up amount of the invest-
ment subgroup entity under subsection (2), is nil, the
GloBE income that would be determined under sub-
section 15(5) if the net GloBE income, and the allocat-
ed adjustment top-up amount and excess negative tax
expense top-up amount of the investment subgroup
entity, were the amounts computed in determining the
top-up amount of the investment subgroup entity un-
der subsection (2); and
(b) in any other case, the GloBE income computed in
determining the investment subgroup entity’s top-up
amount under subsection (2).

(a) the jurisdictional adjusted covered taxes of the
MNE group for the jurisdiction for the election year is
deemed to be equal to the jurisdictional adjusted cov-
ered taxes determined without reference to this para-
graph, plus an amount equal to the deemed distribu-
tion tax of the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the
election year;
(b) a deemed distribution tax recapture account of the
MNE group must be established by the MNE group in
respect of the jurisdiction for the election year, and
(i) the account must be maintained and recorded
by the MNE group, and
(ii) a record of the account must be made available
at the request of the Minister for examination or in-
spection by any person authorized by the Minister
for that purpose;
(c) subject to subsections (4) and (5), the outstanding
balance of the deemed distribution tax recapture ac-
count is determined as follows:
(i) at the end of the election year, the balance is in-
creased by the amount of the deemed distribution
tax of the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the
election year, and
(ii) at the end of each fiscal year (referred to in this
paragraph as a “subsequent year”) following the
election year, the outstanding balances of the
deemed distribution tax recapture accounts in re-
spect of the jurisdiction established for fiscal years
preceding the subsequent year are reduced, but not
below zero, in chronological order
(A) first by the taxes recorded by any standard
constituent entities of the MNE group that are
located in the jurisdiction during the subsequent
year in relation to an actual or deemed distribu-
tion of profits,
(B) then by the amount of any net GloBE loss of
the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the subse-
quent year multiplied by the minimum rate, and
(C) then by the recapture account loss carry-for-
ward of the MNE group for the jurisdiction for
the subsequent year; and
(d) any amount of tax recorded by a standard con-
stituent entity of an MNE group in relation to an actu-
al or deemed distribution of profits is not to be includ-
ed in the adjusted covered taxes of that entity for any
fiscal year to the extent that the amount is applied as a
reduction under clause (c)(ii)(A) in determining the

recapture account of the MNE group.
Definition of deemed distribution tax
(2) The deemed distribution tax, of an MNE group for
a jurisdiction for a fiscal year, means the lesser of
(a) the amount determined by the formula
A × B − C × B
where
A
is the minimum rate,
B
is the net GloBE income of the MNE group for the
jurisdiction for the fiscal year, and
C
is the rate that would be the effective tax rate of
the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the fiscal
year if
(i) it were determined without reference to this
section, and
(ii) paragraph 29(1)(b) were read without refer-
ence to subparagraph (i) in the description of B
in the formula in that paragraph and applied
without reference to section 8, and
(b) the amount of tax that would be payable in respect
of the standard constituent entities of the MNE group
under the eligible distribution tax system of the juris-
diction for the fiscal year, if all the standard con-
stituent entities of the MNE group that are located in
the jurisdiction had distributed all of their income that
was subject to the eligible distribution tax system dur-
ing the fiscal year.
Definition of recapture account loss carry-forward
(3) The recapture account loss carry-forward, of an
MNE group for a jurisdiction for a particular fiscal year,
means the amount determined by the formula

the 
amount 
determined 
under 
clause
(1)(c)(ii)(B) for the jurisdiction for any fiscal
year preceding the particular fiscal year, and

is the total of all amounts each of which is the
portion of the amount determined for C that was
applied at the end of the preceding fiscal year re-
ferred to in the description of C as a reduction
under clause (1)(c)(ii)(B) in determining the bal-
ance of a deemed distribution tax recapture ac-
count of the MNE group for the jurisdiction; and
B
is the total of all amounts each of which is the por-
tion of a recapture account loss carry-forward of the
MNE group for the jurisdiction for a fiscal year pre-
ceding the particular fiscal year that was applied as a
reduction under clause (1)(c)(ii)(C) in determining
the balance of a deemed distribution tax recapture
account of the MNE group for the jurisdiction.
ETR adjustment provision — four-year rule
(4) If the outstanding balance of a deemed distribution
tax recapture account of an MNE group in respect of a ju-
risdiction for a particular fiscal year is greater than nil at
the end of the fourth fiscal year (referred to in this sub-
section as the “recapture year”) immediately following
the particular fiscal year
(a) this subsection applies in the recapture year;
(b) for the purposes of applying subsection 31(1), the
jurisdictional adjusted covered taxes of the MNE
group for the jurisdiction for the particular fiscal year
(being the adjustment year) is deemed to be equal to
the jurisdictional adjusted covered taxes, determined
without reference to this subsection and subsection
31(1), minus an amount equal to the outstanding bal-
ance of the deemed distribution tax recapture account
at the end of the recapture year; and
(c) for the purposes of applying subparagraph
(1)(c)(ii), at the end of any fiscal year following the re-
capture year, the outstanding balance of the deemed
distribution tax recapture account is deemed to be nil.

the MNE group or transfers substantially all of its assets
to a recipient that is not, at the time of the transfer, a
standard constituent entity of the MNE group that is lo-
cated in the jurisdiction

(b) for the purposes of applying subsection 31(1), the
jurisdictional adjusted covered taxes of the MNE
group for the jurisdiction for a fiscal year preceding
the departure year (referred to in this subsection as a
“pre-departure year”) for which the outstanding bal-
ance of the deemed distribution tax recapture account
at the end of the departure year is greater than nil
(each of those pre-departure years being an adjust-
ment year), is deemed to be equal to the jurisdictional
adjusted covered taxes for that pre-departure year, de-
termined without reference to this subsection and
subsection 31(1), minus an amount (referred to in this
subsection as a “recapture amount”) equal to the out-
standing balance of the deemed distribution tax recap-
ture account for that pre-departure year at the end of
the departure year; and
(c) for the purposes of applying this Act at any time
after the departure year, each of the outstanding bal-
ance of the deemed distribution tax recapture account
at the end of the departure year, net GloBE income,
jurisdictional adjusted covered taxes and substance-
based income exclusion amount of the MNE group for
the jurisdiction for a pre-departure year that is an ad-
justment year is deemed to be the amount determined
without reference to this paragraph (referred to in this
paragraph as “the amount otherwise determined”),
minus the product obtained by multiplying the
amount otherwise determined by the disposition re-
capture ratio of the departing constituent entity for
the pre-departure year.
Definition of disposition recapture ratio

DIVISION 5
Reorganizations and Asset Transfers
Constituent entities joining and leaving MNE group
38 (1) Subject to subsection (2), if an entity (referred to
in this subsection as the “transferred entity”) ceases to be
a constituent entity of an MNE group (referred to in this
subsection as the “MNE group” or the “disposing MNE
group”), or becomes a constituent entity of an MNE
group (referred to in this subsection as the “MNE group”
or the “acquiring MNE group”) — including where the
entity becomes the ultimate parent entity of an MNE
group — as a result of a transfer, in a fiscal year (referred
to in this section as the “transfer year”) of the MNE
group, of ownership interests in the transferred entity or
in another entity that holds, directly or indirectly, an
ownership interest in the transferred entity, the following
rules apply:
(a) the transferred entity is to be treated as a con-
stituent entity of the MNE group for the transfer year,
if any portion of the transferred entity’s assets, liabili-
ties, income, expenses or cash flows is included on a
line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial state-
ments of the ultimate parent entity of the MNE group
for the fiscal year;
(b) any portion of the transferred entity’s financial ac-
counting income and adjusted covered taxes that is
not taken into account in the consolidated financial
statements of the ultimate parent entity of the MNE
group for the transfer year is not to be taken into ac-
count in determining any amount under this Act in re-
spect of the MNE group for the transfer year;
(c) the transferred entity’s GloBE income or loss and
adjusted covered taxes, for the transfer year and any
subsequent fiscal years, is to be determined using its
historical carrying value of its assets and liabilities;
(d) in determining, under subsection 32(1), the sub-
stance-based income exclusion amount of the MNE
group for the jurisdiction in which the transferred en-
tity is located for the transfer year,
(i) any portion of the transferred entity’s eligible
payroll costs that is not taken into account in the

statements of the ultimate parent entity of the MNE
group for the transfer year is not to be taken into
account, and
(ii) the eligible tangible asset amount of the trans-
ferred entity for the transfer year is not to exceed
the amount determined by the formula
A × B ÷ C
where
A
is the amount that would be the transferred en-
tity’s eligible tangible asset amount for the
transfer year as determined under subsection
32(9) if that subsection were applied without
reference to this subparagraph,
B
is
(A) if the MNE group is an acquiring MNE
group, the total number of days in the trans-
fer year less the number of days in the trans-
fer year preceding and including the day on
which the disposition occurred, and
(B) if the MNE group is a disposing MNE
group, the total number of days in the trans-
fer year less the number of days in the trans-
fer year following the day on which the dis-
position occurred, and
C
is the total number of days in the transfer year;
(e) deferred tax assets (other than GloBE loss deferred
tax assets) and deferred tax liabilities of the trans-
ferred entity that arose, and did not reverse, before the
transfer are to be taken into account, in the transfer
year and any subsequent fiscal years, in determining
amounts under this Act in respect of the acquiring
MNE group, in the same manner and to the same ex-
tent as if the ultimate parent entity of the acquiring
MNE group had a controlling interest in respect of the
transferred entity in the period that
(i) began with the time at which the deferred tax
asset or deferred tax liability arose, and
(ii) ended at the time of the transfer;
(f) for the purposes of applying section 25 in deter-
mining the transferred entity’s total deferred tax ad-
justment amount,

paragraph as the “transferred deferred tax liabili-
ty”) that was taken into account in determining the
transferred entity’s total deferred tax adjustment
amount for a fiscal year in respect of the disposing

MNE group and that has not reversed in or before
the transfer year the transfer, is deemed
(A) in respect of the disposing MNE group, to
reverse in the group’s fiscal year immediately
preceding the transfer year, and
(B) in respect of the acquiring MNE group, to
have arisen in, and been included in determining
the transferred entity’s total deferred tax adjust-
ment amount for, the transfer year, and
(ii) if the transferred deferred tax liability does not
reverse in any of the five fiscal years of the acquir-
ing MNE group immediately following the transfer
year, the reduction in adjusted covered taxes under
subsection 25(6) in respect of the recapture of the
transferred deferred tax liability is to be applied in
the fifth fiscal year immediately following the trans-
fer year instead of in the transfer year; and
(g) if the transferred entity is a relevant parent entity
of two or more qualifying MNE groups for the transfer
year, the transferred entity is to apply sections 14 and
18 separately in respect of each of those MNE groups
for the transfer year.
Transfers treated as transfers of assets and liabilities
— application
(2) Despite subsection (1), the acquisition or disposition
by a constituent entity of an MNE group of a controlling
interest in another entity (referred to in this subsection
as the “transferred entity”) is to be treated as an acquisi-
tion or disposition, as the case may be, of the assets and
liabilities of the transferred entity for the purposes of sec-
tion 39, if
(a) the disposition — or the disposition giving rise to
the acquisition, as the case may be — is treated in the
same or substantially similar manner as a disposition
of the transferred entity’s assets and liabilities under
the laws of
(i) if the transferred entity is a tax transparent enti-
ty at the time of the disposition, the jurisdiction in
which the assets of the transferred entity are locat-
ed, or

(ii) in any other case, the jurisdiction in which the
transferred entity is located; and
(b) the jurisdiction referred to in subparagraph (a)(i)
or (ii), as the case may be, imposes a covered tax on
the transferor in respect of the disposition — or the
disposition giving rise to the acquisition, as the case
may be — that is calculated by reference to the amount
by which the consideration paid or payable on the dis-
position, or the fair value of the assets and liabilities,
exceeds the transferred entity’s tax basis in respect of
the assets and liabilities.
Acquisitions and dispositions of assets and liabilities
— no GloBE reorganization
39 (1) If a constituent entity of an MNE group disposes
of or acquires assets and liabilities (other than in the
course of a GloBE reorganization) in a fiscal year,
(a) in the case of a disposition, any gain or loss on the
disposition is to be included in determining the dis-
posing constituent entity’s GloBE income or loss for
the year; and
(b) in the case of an acquisition, the GloBE income or
loss of the acquiring constituent entity is to be deter-
mined using
(i) if subsection 38(2) applies to treat the acquiring
constituent entity as having acquired the assets and
liabilities, the fair value of the assets and liabilities,
and
(ii) in any other case, the acquiring constituent en-
tity’s carrying value of the acquired assets and lia-
bilities immediately after the acquisition, deter-
mined under the accounting standard used in
preparing the consolidated financial statements of
the ultimate parent entity of the MNE group.
Transfers of assets and liabilities — GloBE
reorganization
(2) If a constituent entity of an MNE group disposes of or
acquires assets and liabilities in a fiscal year in the course
of a GloBE reorganization
(a) in the case of a disposition, in computing the dis-
posing constituent entity’s GloBE income or loss for
the fiscal year,
(i) if the disposition gives rise to a non-qualifying
gain or loss, the non-qualifying gain or loss is to be
included, and

(ii) in any other case, any gain or loss on the dispo-
sition is to be excluded; and
(b) in the case of an acquisition, the acquiring con-
stituent entity’s GloBE income or loss for the fiscal
year and each subsequent fiscal year is to be deter-
mined using the disposing constituent entity’s carry-
ing values of the assets and liabilities immediately be-
fore the disposition, adjusted, in a manner consistent
with the income tax laws of the jurisdiction in which
the acquiring constituent entity is located, to take into
account any non-qualifying gain or loss arising from
the disposition.
Election to adjust assets and liabilities to fair value
(3) If the filing constituent entity elects for a particular
fiscal year in respect of a particular constituent entity of
the MNE group that is required or permitted, under the
income tax laws of the jurisdiction where it is located, to
adjust the basis of its assets or the amount of its liabili-
ties (referred to in this subsection as “adjusted assets”
and “adjusted liabilities”) for tax purposes to fair value in
the particular fiscal year as a result of a transaction or
event (referred to in this subsection as the “triggering
event”), other than a triggering event that is a sale of as-
sets in the ordinary course of a business or the applica-
tion of a transfer pricing provision under the income tax
laws, the following rules apply:
(a) the fair value for financial accounting purposes of
an adjusted asset or adjusted liability immediately af-
ter the triggering event is to be used in determining
the particular constituent entity’s GloBE income or
loss for the particular fiscal year and each subsequent
fiscal year;
(b) for the purposes of determining the particular
constituent entity’s GloBE income or loss, the particu-
lar constituent entity’s
(i) gain, if any, in respect of an adjusted asset or ad-
justed liability is the amount determined by the for-
mula
A − B − C
where
A
is the fair value of the asset or liability immedi-
ately after the triggering event,
B
is the carrying value of the asset or liability for
financial accounting purposes immediately be-
fore the triggering event, and
C
is the non-qualifying gain, if any, in respect of
the asset or liability arising in connection with
the triggering event, and

entity’s GloBE income or loss for the particular fis-
cal year, or

in computing the particular constituent entity’s
GloBE income or loss for the particular fiscal year
and the four immediately following fiscal years; and
(d) if subparagraph (c)(ii) applies and the particular
constituent entity leaves the MNE group in any of the
five fiscal years referred to in that subparagraph, any
portion of the net total amount referred to in para-
graph (c) that has not been included in computing the
particular constituent entity’s GloBE income or loss
for a previous fiscal year is to be included in comput-
ing its GloBE income or loss for the final fiscal year in
which it was a constituent entity of the MNE group.

Tax Attributes on Transition
Transition — deferred tax assets and liabilities
48 (1) Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (5), in deter-
mining the total deferred tax adjustment amount of a
constituent entity of an MNE group that is located in a
jurisdiction for the GloBE transition year of the MNE
group in respect of the jurisdiction and each subsequent
fiscal year in which the constituent entity is included in
the MNE group,
(a) each deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability
that is reflected in the constituent entity’s financial ac-
counts at the beginning of the GloBE transition year is
to be taken into account to the extent of
(i) if the constituent entity can demonstrate that a
deferred tax asset is attributable to a loss of the
constituent entity that would have been taken into
account in determining its GloBE income or loss
had the GloBE income or loss been determined for
the prior fiscal year in which the loss arose, the
amount that the deferred tax asset would be if the
rate of tax that applied in determining the deferred
tax asset were the minimum rate,
(ii) if a deferred tax asset is in respect of a tax cred-
it, the lesser of
(A) the amount of the deferred tax asset, and
(B) the amount determined by the formula
A ÷ B × C
where
A
is the amount of the deferred tax asset,
B
is the applicable tax rate in the fiscal year
immediately preceding the GloBE transition
year, and
C
is the minimum rate, and
(iii) in any other case, the lesser of
(A) the amount of the deferred tax asset or de-
ferred tax liability, as the case may be, and
(B) the amount that the deferred tax asset or de-
ferred tax liability would be if the tax rate

applicable in determining the deferred tax asset
or deferred tax liability were the minimum rate;
(b) if a deferred tax asset referred to in paragraph (a)
is in respect of a credit and the tax rate applicable to
the constituent entity in a subsequent fiscal year (re-
ferred to in this paragraph as the “re-application
year”) is different from the applicable tax rate in the
fiscal year immediately preceding the GloBE transi-
tion year,
(i) the formula in clause (a)(ii)(B) must be re-ap-
plied to the outstanding balance of the tax credit in
the constituent entity’s financial accounts at the be-
ginning of the re-application year to determine the
revised deferred tax asset,
(ii) the change in the amount of the deferred tax as-
set resulting from the re-application of the formula
must not be treated as deferred tax expense includ-
ed in the computation of the total deferred tax ad-
justment amount of the constituent entity in the re-
application year or any other fiscal year, and

year and subsequent fiscal years must be deter-
mined based on the amount of the reversal of the
revised deferred tax asset; and
(c) paragraph 25(2)(a) and subsection 25(6) do not ap-
ply in respect of the deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities referred to in paragraph (a).
Excluded deferred tax assets
(2) In applying subsection (1), a deferred tax asset that is
reflected in a constituent entity’s financial accounts at the
beginning of the GloBE transition year of the MNE group
in respect of the jurisdiction in which the constituent en-
tity is located is not to be taken into account in determin-
ing the constituent entity’s total deferred tax adjustment
amount if the deferred tax asset arises
(a) as a result of a transaction that occurs on or after
December 1, 2021 and before the GloBE transition
year; and
(b) in respect of
(i) an amount that

stituent entity’s income or profits in respect of
which an entity is subject to an income or profits
tax imposed by the government of the jurisdic-
tion in which the constituent entity is located,
and
(B) would not be taken into account in comput-
ing the constituent entity’s GloBE income or loss
for the GloBE transition year if the amount arose
in the GloBE transition year, or
(ii) an amount that

come or profits in respect of which an entity is
subject to an income or profits tax imposed by
the government of the jurisdiction in which the
constituent entity is located, and
(B) would be included in computing the con-
stituent entity’s GloBE income or loss for the
GloBE transition year if the amount arose in the
GloBE transition year.
Valuation adjustments and accounting recognition
adjustments
(3) In applying subsection (1), the impact of any valua-
tion adjustment or accounting recognition adjustment
with respect to the amount of a deferred tax asset is not
to be taken into account.
Asset transfers before transferor transition year —
conditions

2021, and before the earlier of the QDMTT transition
year and the GloBE transition year (referred to in this
section as the “transferor transition year”) of its MNE
group in respect of the jurisdiction in which it is locat-
ed — to another entity (referred to in this section as
the “transferee”);
(b) the asset is not manufactured, nor of a class or de-
scription sold, in the course of carrying on a trade by
the transferor or the transferee; and
(c) had this Act applied immediately before the trans-
fer, the transferor and transferee would have been
constituent entities of the same MNE group.

Asset transfers before transferor transition year —
consequences
(5) Subject to subsection (9), if this subsection applies in
respect of an asset
(a) the carrying value of the asset at the beginning of
the transferor transition year is deemed to be equal to
the carrying value of the asset to the transferor imme-
diately before the transfer referred to in paragraph
(4)(a), adjusted for
(i) any subsequent capitalized expenditure incurred
in respect of the asset before the transferor transi-
tion year, and
(ii) the portion of any amortization and deprecia-
tion of the asset that would have been recognized
before the transferor transition year if any increase
in the carrying value resulting from the transfer had
not occurred; and
(b) in applying subsection (1),
(i) any deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabili-
ties in respect of the asset that are reflected in any
entity’s financial accounts and that result from the
transfer are not to be taken into account in deter-
mining the total deferred tax adjustment amount of
any constituent entity, except to the extent provid-
ed under subparagraph (ii), and
(ii) a deferred tax asset of the transferee that is de-
scribed in subparagraph (i) may be taken into ac-
count but, for this purpose, the amount of that de-
ferred tax asset is deemed to be equal to the lesser
of the amount actually recorded in the transferee’s
financial accounts as a result of the transfer and the
total of the following amounts, adjusted for any
capitalized expenditure, amortization and deprecia-
tion in respect of the asset that are referred to in
subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii):
(A) the portion of the current tax expense for a
fiscal year of the transferor in respect of covered
taxes that is demonstrated to have resulted from
the transfer, and
(B) the portion of the current tax expense for a
fiscal year of any other entity in respect of cov-
ered taxes that is demonstrated to have resulted
from the transfer and that would have been allo-
cated to the transferor under section 24 if

Deemed transfer
(6) For the purposes of subsection (4), an asset is
deemed to be transferred by a transferor to a transferee
on or after December 1, 2021, and before the transferor
transition year, if a transaction or arrangement is entered
into during that period in respect of the asset that
(a) would not, in the absence of this subsection, be re-
garded as a transfer of the asset by a transferor to a
transferee on or after December 1, 2021, and before
the transferor transition year; and
(b) is accounted for by one or more parties involved in
the transaction or arrangement in the same or a simi-
lar manner to a change in ownership of the asset, or as
giving rise to an asset.
Interpretation — single-entity transactions
(7) For greater certainty, the transaction or arrangement
referred to in subsection (6) may involve only one entity
— including where it results in an increase to the carrying
value of an asset, or in the creation or increase of a de-
ferred tax asset — in which case the transferor and trans-
feree referred to in subsection (5) are the same entity.
Interpretation — pre-existing deferred tax assets and
liabilities
(8) For greater certainty, for the purposes of subpara-
graph (5)(b)(i), any deferred tax assets or deferred tax li-
abilities in respect of an asset reflected in the transferee’s
financial accounts immediately after the transfer and
that were reflected in the transferor’s financial accounts
immediately before the transfer are not deferred tax as-
sets or deferred tax liabilities resulting from the transfer.
Election — non-application of paragraph (5)(a) and
subparagraph (5)(b)(ii)
(9) Paragraph (5)(a) and subparagraph (5)(b)(ii) do not
apply in respect of an asset transferred by a transferor to
a transferee that is a constituent entity of an MNE group,
if
(a) the filing constituent entity of the MNE group
elects; and

means to another person with which the transferor was
not, at that time, dealing at arm’s length, the transferee
and transferor are jointly and severally, or solidarily, li-
able to pay under this Act an amount equal to the lesser
of
(a) the amount determined by the formula
A − (B − C)

A
is the amount, if any, by which the fair market val-
ue of the property at that time exceeds the fair
market value at that time of the consideration giv-
en by the transferee for the transfer of the proper-

Limitation
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit the liability of the trans-
feror under any other provision of this Act or the liability
of the transferee for the interest that the transferee is li-
able to pay under this Act on an assessment in respect of
the amount that the transferee is liable to pay because of
that subsection.
Fair market value of undivided interest or right
(4) For the purposes of this section, the fair market value
at any time of an undivided interest in, or for civil law an
undivided right in, a property that is expressed as a pro-
portionate interest or right in that property is deemed to
be equal to the same proportion of the fair market value
of that property at that time.
Assessment
(5) Despite subsection 85(1), the Minister may at any
time assess a transferee in respect of any amount payable
because of this section, and this Part applies to the trans-
feree with any modifications that the circumstances re-
quire.
Rules applicable
(6) If a transferor and transferee become, because of
subsection (2), jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable
in respect of part or all of the liability of the transferor
under this Act, the following rules apply:
(a) a payment by the transferee on account of the
transferee’s liability discharges, to the extent of the
payment, the joint liability; and
(b) a payment by the transferor on account of the
transferor’s liability discharges the transferee’s liabili-
ty only to the extent that the payment operates to re-
duce the transferor’s liability to an amount less than
the amount in respect of which the transferee is, be-
cause of subsection (2), jointly and severally, or soli-
darily, liable.
Anti-avoidance rules
(7) For the purposes of subsections (1) to (6), if a person
(referred to in this section as the “transferor”) transfers
property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust
or by any other means whatever to another person (re-

(a) the transferor is deemed to not be dealing at arm’s
length with the transferee at all times in the transac-
tion or series of transactions if
(i) the transferor and the transferee do not deal at
arm’s length at any time during the period begin-
ning immediately before the transaction or series of
transactions and ending immediately after the
transaction or series of transactions, and
(ii) it is reasonable to conclude that one of the pur-
poses of undertaking or arranging the transaction
or series of transactions is to avoid joint and sever-
al, or solidary, liability of the transferee and the
transferor under this section for an amount payable
under this Act;
(b) an amount that the transferor is liable to pay un-
der this Act (including, for greater certainty, an
amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this
section, regardless of whether the Minister has made
an assessment under subsection (5) in respect of that
amount) is deemed to have become payable in the fis-
cal year in which the property is transferred, if it is
reasonable to conclude that one of the purposes of the
transfer of the property is to avoid the payment of a
future amount payable under this Act by the transfer-
or or transferee; and
(c) the amount determined for A in paragraph (2)(a)
is deemed to be the greater of

is the fair market value of the property at the

sideration (that is held by the transferor)
given for the property at any time during the
period beginning immediately before the
transaction or series of transactions and
ending immediately after the transaction or
series of transactions, or

cancelled or extinguished during the period
referred to in clause (A),

denominated in a currency other than the Canadian dol-
lar, that amount is to be converted to Canadian dollars
using the average for the fiscal year of the daily rates of
exchange quoted by the Bank of Canada, or if there is no
daily rate quoted by the Bank of Canada for a particular
day, a daily rate of exchange that is acceptable to the
Minister, in respect of the two currencies.

extent that its value exceeds, at the time the request is re-
ceived by the Minister, the amount that is sought to be
secured.

made under subsection (1) in respect of a debtor is to be
registered in the Court and, when so registered, has the
same effect, and all proceedings may be taken on the cer-
tificate, as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court
against the debtor for a debt in the amount certified plus
interest on the amount as provided under this Act to the
day of payment and, for the purposes of those proceed-
ings, the certificate is deemed to be a judgment of the
Court against the debtor for a debt due to His Majesty in
right of Canada and enforceable as such.
Costs
(3) All reasonable costs and charges incurred or paid for
the registration in the Federal Court of a certificate made
under subsection (1), or in respect of any proceedings
taken to collect the amount certified, are recoverable in
the same manner as if they had been included in the
amount certified in the certificate when it was registered.

dence of a registered certificate in respect of a debtor, a
writ of that Court issued in accordance with the certifi-
cate or any notification of the document or writ (which

(a) a charge, lien or priority is created on, or a binding
interest is created in, property in the province, or any
interest in, or for civil law any right in, such property,
held by the debtor, or
(b) such property, or interest or right in the property,
is otherwise bound
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
memorial were a document that is evidence of a judg-
ment referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(b), and the charge, lien, priori-
ty or binding interest created is subordinate to any
charge, lien, priority or binding interest in respect of

er creditors were taken before the day on which the
memorial was filed, registered or otherwise recorded.

(c) to cancel or withdraw the memorial wholly or in
respect of any of the property, or interests or rights,
affected by the memorial, or

tion or other recording of the memorial in favour of
any right, charge, lien or priority that has been or is
intended to be filed, registered or otherwise recorded
in respect of any property, or interest or rights, affect-
ed by the memorial,
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
memorial were a document that is evidence of a judg-
ment referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(b). However, if in any such
proceeding or as a condition precedent to any such pro-
ceeding, any order, consent or ruling is required under
the law of the province to be made or given by the superi-
or court of the province or by a judge or official of the
court, a similar order, consent or ruling may be made or
given by the Federal Court or by a judge or official of the
Federal Court and, when so made or given, has the same
effect for the purposes of the proceeding as if it were
made or given by the superior court of the province or by
a judge or official of the court.

(7) If
(a) a memorial is presented for filing, registration or
other recording under subsection (4), or a document

ceeding referred to in subsection (6), to any official in
the land registry system, personal property or movable
property registry system, or other registry system, of a
province, or

province to make the filing, registration or other
recording,
the memorial or document must be accepted for filing,
registration or other recording or the access must be
granted, as the case may be, in the same manner and to
the same extent as if the memorial or document relating
to the memorial were a document that is evidence of a
judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount
referred to in paragraph (4)(b) for the purpose of a simi-
lar proceeding. However, if the memorial or document is
issued by the Federal Court or signed or certified by a
judge or official of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or
other evidence required under the law of the province to
be provided with or to accompany the memorial or docu-
ment in the proceedings is deemed to have been provided

a sheriff or other person must not, without the written
consent of the Minister, sell or otherwise dispose of any
property or publish any notice or otherwise advertise in
respect of any sale or other disposition of any property as
a result of any process issued or charge, lien, priority or
binding interest created in any proceeding to collect an
amount certified in a certificate made under subsection
(1), interest on the amount or costs. However, if that con-
sent is subsequently given, any property that would have
been affected by that process, charge, lien, priority or
binding interest if the Minister’s consent had been given
at the time the process was issued or the charge, lien, pri-
ority or binding interest was created, as the case may be,
is to be bound, seized, attached, charged or otherwise af-
fected as it would have been if that consent had been giv-
en at the time that process was issued or the charge, lien,
priority or binding interest was created, as the case may
be.
Completion of notices, etc.
(9) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or
other person in a minute, notice or document required to
be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsec-
tion (8), be so set out without the written consent of the
Minister, the sheriff or other person must complete the
minute, notice or document to the extent possible with-
out that information and, when that consent of the Min-
ister is given, a further minute, notice or document set-
ting out all the information must be completed for the
same purpose, and the sheriff or other person, having
complied with this subsection, is deemed to have com-
plied with the Act, regulation or rule requiring the infor-
mation to be set out in the minute, notice or document.
Application for order
(10) A sheriff or other person that is unable, because of
subsection (8) or (9), to comply with any law or rule of
court is bound by any order made by a judge of the Fed-
eral Court, on an ex parte application by the Minister, for
the purpose of giving effect to the proceeding, charge,
lien, priority or binding interest.

subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a se-
cured claim under that Act; and
(b) to also be a claim referred to in paragraph 86(2)(a)
of that Act.
Details in certificates and memorials
(12) Despite any other law of Canada or a province, in
any certificate made under subsection (1) in respect of a
debtor, any memorial that is evidence of a certificate or
any writ or document issued for the purpose of collecting
an amount certified, it is sufficient for all purposes
(a) to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor,
the total of amounts payable by the debtor without
setting out the separate amounts making up that total;
and
(b) to refer to the rate of interest to be charged on the
separate amounts making up the amount payable in
general terms as interest at the rate prescribed under
section 4301 of the Income Tax Regulations, with any
modifications that the circumstances require, applica-
ble from time to time on amounts payable to the Re-
ceiver General for Canada, without indicating the spe-
cific rates of interest to be charged on each of the sep-
arate amounts or to be charged for any period.
Garnishment
128 (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a
person is, or will be within one year, liable to make a pay-
ment to another person that is liable to pay an amount
under this Act (referred to in this section as a “debtor”),
the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the person
to pay without delay, if the money is immediately
payable, and in any other case, as and when the money
becomes payable, the money otherwise payable to the
debtor in whole or in part to the Receiver General for
Canada on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act.
Garnishment of loans or advances
(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), if
the Minister has knowledge or suspects that within 90
days
(a) a bank, credit union, trust company or other simi-
lar person (referred to in this section as an “institu-
tion”) will loan or advance money to, or make a pay-
ment on behalf of, or make a payment in respect of a
negotiable instrument issued by, a debtor that is in-
debted to the institution and that has granted security
in respect of the indebtedness, or

(b) a person, other than an institution, will loan or ad-
vance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, a
debtor that the Minister knows or suspects
(i) is employed by, or is engaged in providing ser-
vices or property to, that person or was or will be,
within 90 days, so employed or engaged, or
(ii) if that person is a corporation, is not dealing at
arm’s length with that person,
the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the insti-
tution or person, as the case may be, to pay in whole or in
part to the Receiver General for Canada on account of the
debtor’s liability under this Act the money that would
otherwise be so loaned, advanced or paid.
Effect of receipt
(3) A receipt issued by the Minister for money paid as re-
quired under this section is a good and sufficient dis-
charge of the original liability to the extent of the pay-
ment.
Effect of requirement
(4) If the Minister has, under this section, required a
person to pay to the Receiver General for Canada on ac-
count of a debtor’s liability under this Act money other-
wise payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent,
remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or another periodic
payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to
be made by the person to the debtor until the liability un-
der this Act is satisfied and the requirement operates to
require payments to the Receiver General for Canada out
of each such payment of any amount that is specified by
the Minister in a notice in writing.
Failure to comply
(5) A person that fails to comply with a requirement un-
der subsection (1) or (4) is liable to pay to His Majesty in
right of Canada an amount equal to the amount that the
person was required under that subsection to pay to the
Receiver General for Canada.
Other failures to comply
(6) An institution or person that fails to comply with a
requirement under subsection (2) with respect to money
to be loaned, advanced or paid is liable to pay to His
Majesty in right of Canada an amount equal to the lesser
of

quired under that subsection to pay to the Receiver
General for Canada.
Assessment
(7) The Minister may assess any person for any amount
payable under this section by the person to the Receiver
General for Canada and, if the Minister sends a notice of
assessment, sections 70 and 82 to 97 apply with any mod-
ifications that the circumstances require.
Time limit
(8) An assessment of an amount payable under this sec-
tion by a person to the Receiver General for Canada is
not to be made more than four years after the person re-
ceives the notice from the Minister requiring the pay-
ment.
Effect of payment as required
(9) If an amount that would otherwise have been ad-
vanced, loaned or paid to or on behalf of a debtor is paid
by a person to the Receiver General for Canada in accor-
dance with a notice from the Minister issued under this
section, or with an assessment made under subsection
(7), the person is deemed for all purposes to have ad-
vanced, loaned or paid the amount to or on behalf of the
debtor.
Recovery by deduction or set-off
129 If a person is indebted to His Majesty in right of
Canada under this Act, the Minister may require the re-
tention by way of deduction or set-off of any amount that
the Minister may specify out of any amount that may be
or become payable to that person by His Majesty in right
of Canada.
Acquisition of debtor’s property
130 For the purpose of collecting debts owed by a per-
son to His Majesty in right of Canada under this Act, the
Minister may purchase or otherwise acquire any interest
in, or for civil law any right in, the person’s property that
the Minister is given a right to acquire in legal proceed-
ings or under a court order or that is offered for sale or
redemption and may dispose of any interest or right so
acquired in any manner that the Minister considers rea-
sonable.
Money seized from debtor
131 (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a
person is holding money that was seized by a police offi-
cer, in the course of administering or enforcing the crimi-
nal law of Canada, from another person that is liable to
pay any amount under this Act (referred to in this section

as the “debtor”) and that is restorable to the debtor, the
Minister may in writing require the person to turn over
the money otherwise restorable to the debtor, in whole or
in part, to the Receiver General for Canada on account of
the debtor’s liability under this Act.
Receipt of Minister
(2) A receipt issued by the Minister for money turned
over as required under this section is a good and suffi-
cient discharge of the requirement to restore the money
to the debtor to the extent of the amount so turned over.
Seizure if failure to pay
132 (1) If a person fails to pay an amount as required
under this Act, the Minister may in writing give 30 days’
notice to the person, addressed to their latest known ad-
dress, of the Minister’s intention to direct that the per-
son’s goods and chattels, or moveable property, be seized
and disposed of. If the person fails to make the payment
before the expiry of the 30 days, the Minister may issue a
certificate of the failure and direct that the person’s
goods and chattels, or movable property, be seized.
Disposition
(2) Property that has been seized under subsection (1)
must be kept for 10 days at the expense and risk of the

dispose of the property in a manner that the Minister
considers appropriate in the circumstances.

tion of the amount owing and all expenses, must be paid
or returned to the owner of the property seized.

ment of any amount for which the person is liable under
this Act or would be so liable if the time for payment had
arrived, and the amount must be paid without delay de-
spite any other provision of this Act.

tions that the circumstances require.
Authorization to proceed without delay
134 (1) Despite section 125, if, on an ex parte applica-
tion by the Minister, a judge is satisfied that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the collection of all or
any part of an amount assessed in respect of a person
would be jeopardized by a delay in its collection, the
judge must, on any terms that the judge considers rea-
sonable in the circumstances, authorize the Minister to,
without delay, take any of the actions referred to in sec-
tions 127 to 132 in respect of that amount.

spect of an amount assessed in respect of a person may
be granted by a judge even if a notice of assessment in re-
spect of that amount has not been sent to the person at or
before the day on which the application is made if the
judge is satisfied that the receipt of the notice of assess-
ment by the person would likely further jeopardize the
collection of the amount. For the purposes of sections
124, 127 to 129, 131 and 132, the amount in respect of
which an authorization is granted is deemed to be an
amount payable under this Act.
Affidavits

in the context of an application made under this section
may be based on belief, in which case the affidavit must
include the grounds for that belief.
Service of authorization and notice of assessment
(4) An authorization granted under this section in re-
spect of a person must be served by the Minister on the
person within 72 hours after it is granted, unless the
judge orders the authorization to be served at some other
time specified in the authorization, and, if a notice of as-
sessment has not been sent to the person at or before the
time of the application, a notice of assessment for the as-
sessed period must be served on the person together with
the authorization.

son must be effected by

as and when required under this section, the Minister

must determine the question summarily and may con-
firm, vary or set aside the authorization and make any
other order that the judge considers appropriate.

in connection with anything done or being done under
this section and there is no relevant direction in this sec-
tion, a judge may give any direction with regard to the
course to be followed that, the judge considers appropri-
ate.

that physical activity may cause adverse effects within
federal jurisdiction or direct or incidental adverse effects.
Factors
(2) If the Minister is of the opinion that the carrying out
of the physical activity may cause adverse effects within
federal jurisdiction or direct or incidental adverse effects,
the Minister may, in deciding whether to make an order,
consider
(a) public concerns related to the adverse effects with-
in federal jurisdiction — or the direct or incidental ad-
verse effects — that may be caused by the carrying out
of the physical activity;
(b) the adverse impacts that the physical activity may
have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of
Canada — including Indigenous women — recognized
and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act,
1982;
(c) any relevant assessment referred to in section 92,
93 or 95;

exists that would permit a jurisdiction to address the
adverse effects within federal jurisdiction — and the
direct or incidental adverse effects — that may be
