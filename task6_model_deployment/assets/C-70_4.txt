draws conditions to which the disclosure is subject, the
judge’s consideration of the motion or any hearing or ap-
peal must be terminated in relation to that information,

Disclosure order

national defence or national security, the judge may, by
order, authorize the disclosure of the information or
facts.
Disclosure — conditions
(2) If the judge concludes that the disclosure of the infor-
mation or facts would be injurious to international rela-
tions or national defence or national security but that the
public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance the
public interest in non-disclosure, the judge may by order,
after considering both the public interest in disclosure
and the form of and conditions to disclosure that are
most likely to limit any injury to international relations
or national defence or national security resulting from
disclosure, authorize the disclosure, subject to any condi-
tions that the judge considers appropriate, of all or part
of the information or facts, a summary of the information

further appeal from a judgment that confirms the order
is available.

the opinion of the judge, is reliable and appropriate, even
if it would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian
law, and may base their decision on that evidence.

(b) conduct a hearing in private and in the absence of
the non-governmental party and their counsel.
Procedure
(3) In conducting a hearing under paragraph (2)(b), the
judge must
(a) deal with all matters as informally and expedi-
tiously as the circumstances and considerations of
fairness and natural justice permit;
(b) without disclosing the information referred to in
subsection (1), ensure that the non-governmental par-
ty to the federal proceeding is provided with a summa-
ry of the information that enables that party to be rea-
sonably informed of the case; and

hold the hearing in the National Capital Region, as de-
scribed in the schedule to the National Capital Act.
Decision

Responsibilities
(2) A special counsel may
(a) make oral and written representations with re-
spect to the information or other evidence that has
been filed with the court but has not been disclosed to
the non-governmental party and their counsel;
(b) participate in, and cross-examine witnesses who
testify during, any part of the proceeding that is held
in private and in the absence of the non-governmental
party and their counsel; and
(c) exercise, with the judge’s authorization, any other
powers that are necessary to protect the interests of
the non-governmental party.
For greater certainty
(3) For greater certainty, the special counsel is not a par-
ty to the federal proceeding and the relationship between
the special counsel and the non-governmental party is
not that of lawyer and client.
Protection of communications with special counsel
(4) However, a communication between the non-govern-
mental party or their counsel and the special counsel
that, if the relationship were one of lawyer and client,
would be subject to solicitor-client privilege or the pro-
fessional secrecy of advocates is deemed to be subject to
that privilege or professional secrecy. For greater certain-
ty, in respect of that communication, the special counsel
is not a compellable witness in any proceeding.

thing they do or omit to do in good faith under this Act.

disclosed to the non-governmental party and their coun-
sel.
Restrictions on communications — special counsel

ceived by the special counsel, the special counsel may,
during the remainder of the federal proceeding and any

appeal in respect of it, communicate with another person
about the federal proceeding or the appeal only with the
judge’s or appeal court’s authorization and subject to any
conditions that the judge or appeal court considers ap-
propriate.
Restrictions on communications — other persons
(2) If the special counsel is authorized to communicate
with a person, the judge or appeal court may prohibit
that person from communicating with anyone else about
the federal proceeding or appeal during its remainder or
may impose conditions with respect to such a communi-
cation during that period.
Disclosure and communication prohibited
38.39 With the exception of communications authorized
by a judge or disclosures permitted under section 38.22, it
is prohibited for a person to
(a) disclose information or other evidence that is dis-
closed to them under section 38.37 or 38.38 and that is
treated as confidential by the judge; or
(b) communicate with another person about the con-
tent of any part of a federal proceeding, or an appeal
in respect of it, that is heard in private and in the ab-
sence of the non-governmental party and their coun-
sel.
Fairness
38.4 (1) The judge may, if they are of the opinion that
they are unable to conduct a fair hearing because the
non-governmental party is not reasonably informed of
the case, make an order granting an appropriate remedy
to the non-governmental party.
Potential orders
(2) The orders that may be made under subsection (1)
include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a) an order allowing or dismissing the federal pro-
ceeding; and
(b) an order finding against any party on any issue re-
lating to information the disclosure of which is prohib-
ited.
For greater certainty
(3) For greater certainty, a remedy referred to in subsec-
tion (1) must not include the disclosure of information
ordered not to be disclosed under subsection 38.26(3) or
38.41(4).

activities in relation to political or governmental pro-
cesses in Canada
Preamble
Whereas Canada’s national security is increasingly
challenged by foreign states or powers and their
proxies;
Whereas interference by foreign states or powers
and their proxies has a significant impact on
Canada’s international relations and foreign policy;
Whereas efforts by foreign states or powers and their
proxies to influence, in a non-transparent manner,
political and governmental processes at all levels of
government 
in 
Canada 
have 
systemic 
effects
throughout the country and endanger democracy,
sovereignty and core Canadian values;
Whereas efforts by foreign states or powers and their
proxies to influence, in a non-transparent manner,
political and governmental processes at one level of
government in Canada may have effects on the politi-
cal and governmental processes of another level of
government;
Whereas some of those efforts have a particularly
negative effect on certain communities in Canada;
Whereas there is a growing consensus in Canada and
among its allies that foreign influence registries are a
necessary tool to lessen foreign interference in the
affairs of sovereign states;
Whereas it is desirable that information respecting
certain foreign influence activities that are carried out
in relation to political or governmental processes in
Canada be registered in a way that makes it accessi-
ble to the public;
Whereas the registration of that information should
not impede freedoms that are vital to Canada’s politi-
cal culture;
And whereas it is desirable that an independent pub-
lic office holder administer and enforce requirements
respecting the registration of that information;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:

ner for doing so; and
