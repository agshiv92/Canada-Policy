CHAPTER 2
An Act respecting a federal framework on autism
spectrum disorder
[Assented to 30th March, 2023]
Preamble
Whereas autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong neu-
rodevelopmental disorder that includes impairments
in language, communication skills and social interac-
tions, combined with restricted and repetitive be-
haviours, interests or activities;
Whereas Parliament recognizes that there is a need
for autistic persons and their families to receive di-
rect, timely and ongoing access to financial support,
treatment and services;
Whereas there is no coordinated national strategy
that would expand the scope of support to ensure
consistency and long-term solutions, especially for
persons over the age of 18 years;
Whereas autistic Canadians, their families and their
caregivers would benefit from the development and
implementation of a federal framework that provides
for best practices, research, education, awareness,
treatment, equal access to medical and financial sup-
ports, and assistance with employment and housing
challenges;
And whereas the development of that federal frame-
work would benefit from the involvement of autistic
Canadians, their families and their caregivers;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
