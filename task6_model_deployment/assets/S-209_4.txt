CHAPTER 7
An Act respecting Pandemic Observance Day
[Assented to 30th April, 2024]
Preamble
Whereas, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Or-
ganization characterized the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) epidemic as a global pandemic;
Whereas March 11, 2021, was designated — by order
in council on March 8, 2021, and by proclamation on
March 31, 2021 — as a “National Day of Observance”
to honour those who have died of COVID-19, to rec-
ognize those working on the front lines and to ac-
knowledge COVID-19’s serious effects on the health
of Canada’s population;
Whereas it is important to acknowledge the multidi-
mensional effects of the pandemic on every person
in Canada;
Whereas this pandemic has worsened the various
forms of inequality in Canada and has had a dispro-
portionate impact on the vulnerable people within
society and members of historically disadvantaged
groups;
And whereas it is fitting that March 11 of each year
be officially designated as “Pandemic Observance
Day” in order to give the Canadian public an oppor-
tunity to commemorate the efforts to get through the
pandemic, to remember its effects and to reflect on
ways to prepare for any future pandemics;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
Short Title
Short title
1 This Act may be cited as the Pandemic Day Act.
