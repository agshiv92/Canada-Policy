CHAPTER 17
An Act to reduce poverty and to support the financial
security of persons with disabilities by establishing
the Canada disability benefit and making a conse-
quential amendment to the Income Tax Act
[Assented to 22nd June, 2023]
Preamble
Whereas working-age persons with disabilities are
more likely to live in poverty than working-age per-
sons without disabilities, because of economic and
social exclusion;
Whereas persons with disabilities often face barriers
to employment, including work disincentives such as
the loss of income and other benefits as a result of
becoming employed;
Whereas persons with disabilities may face addition-
al barriers because of their gender, racialized or In-
digenous status or other intersecting statuses;
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to
the economic and social inclusion of persons with
disabilities, as evidenced by its introduction of the
Accessible Canada Act;
Whereas the Canadian Charter of Rights and Free-
doms guarantees persons with disabilities the right
to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law
without discrimination;
Whereas reducing poverty contributes to the pro-
gressive realization of Canada’s international obliga-
tions under the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities;
Whereas Canada aspires to be a world leader in the
eradication of poverty, and Parliament, with a view to
this objective, enacted the Poverty Reduction Act;
Whereas progress made by Canada in reducing
poverty for persons with disabilities and others con-
tributes to meeting the Sustainable Development
Goals of the United Nations;
2021-2022-2023

Page 6 
Whereas the Government of Canada seeks to build
on its successes in addressing poverty through pro-
viding benefits for seniors and for families with chil-
dren;
Whereas, in the spirit of “Nothing Without Us”, the
Government of Canada recognizes the importance, in
developing support measures for persons with dis-
abilities, of engaging with the disability community,
in accordance with the Accessible Canada Act, which
specifies that “persons with disabilities must be in-
volved in the development and design of laws, poli-
cies, programs, services and structures”;
And whereas Parliament recognizes the leading role
that the provinces and territories play in providing
supports and services to persons with disabilities and
the importance of engaging with them in developing
income supports and other support services;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
