come of a corporation, the amount is deemed not to have
been deducted in computing the corporation’s taxable in-
come, or taxable income earned in Canada, as the case
may be, for the purpose of computing the tax payable by
the corporation under subsection (2), if
(a) the deduction is in respect of an amount that can

rectly or indirectly, to a person or partnership that was
not dealing at arm’s length with the corporation;

may be deducted, in computing the income of the holder
of the relevant FHSA for the taxation year, an amount
equal to the amount determined by the formula
A − B
where
A
is the amount included by application of subsection
(11) in computing the income of the holder as a con-
sequence of the property being used as security for a
loan; and
B
is the net loss (exclusive of payments by the trust as
or on account of interest) sustained by the trust in
consequence of its using the property, or permitting
it to be used, as security for the loan and not as a re-
sult of a change in the fair market value of the prop-
erty.
Successor holder

(a) the survivor is a qualifying individual and the bal-
ance of the FHSA is transferred to a RRSP or a RRIF
of the survivor, or distributed to the survivor in accor-
dance with subsection (14), by the end of the year fol-
lowing the year of death; or

FHSA, an amount is distributed in a taxation year from
the FHSA to, or on behalf of, a beneficiary, the amount
shall be included in computing the beneficiary’s income
for the year.
Deemed transfer or distribution
(15) If an amount is distributed at any time from the
FHSA of a deceased holder to the holder’s legal represen-
tative and a survivor of the holder is entitled to all or a
portion of the amount in full or partial satisfaction of the
survivor’s rights as a person beneficially interested under
the deceased’s estate, the following rules apply:
(a) if a payment is made from the estate to a FHSA,
RRSP or RRIF of the survivor, the payment is deemed
to be a transfer from the FHSA to the extent that
(i) it is so designated jointly by the legal represen-
tative and the survivor in prescribed form filed with
the Minister, and
(ii) it meets the conditions to be a transferred
amount under subsections (7) to (10);
(b) if a payment is made from the estate to the sur-
vivor, the payment is deemed for the purposes of sub-
section (14) to be a distribution to the survivor as a
beneficiary to the extent that it is so designated jointly
by the legal representative and the survivor in pre-
scribed form filed with the Minister; and
(c) for the purposes of subsection (14), the amount
distributed to the legal representative from the FHSA
is deemed to be reduced by the amounts designated in
paragraphs (a) and (b).

action or as part of a series of transactions
