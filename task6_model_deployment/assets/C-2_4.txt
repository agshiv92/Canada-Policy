response to COVID-19

DECEMBER 17, 2021
BILL C-2

Page 2 
RECOMMENDATION
Her Excellency the Governor General recommends to the House
of Commons the appropriation of public revenue under the cir-
cumstances, in the manner and for the purposes set out in a
measure entitled “An Act to provide further support in response
to COVID-19”.
SUMMARY
Part 1 amends the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Regula-
tions to extend subsidies under the Canada Emergency Wage
Subsidy (CEWS), the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS),
and the Canada Recovery Hiring Program until May 7, 2022, as
part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Support under
the CEWS and the CERS would be available to the tourism and
hospitality sector and to the hardest-hit organizations that face
significant revenue declines. Eligible entities under these rules
would need to demonstrate a revenue decline over the course of
12 months of the pandemic, as well as a current-month revenue
decline. In addition, organizations subject to a qualifying public
health restriction would be eligible for support, if they have one
or more locations subject to a public health restriction lasting for
at least seven days that requires them to cease some or all of
their activities. Part 1 also allows the government to extend the
subsidies by regulation but no later than July 2, 2022.
Part 2 enacts the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit Act to autho-
rize the payment of the Canada worker lockdown benefit in re-
gions where a lockdown is imposed for reasons related to
COVID-19. It also makes consequential amendments to the In-
come Tax Act and the Income Tax Regulations.
Part 3 amends the Canada Recovery Benefits Act to, among oth-
er things,
(a) extend the period within which a person may be eligible
for a Canada recovery sickness benefit or a Canada recovery
caregiving benefit;
(b) increase the maximum number of weeks in respect of
which a Canada recovery sickness benefit is payable to a per-
son from four to six; and
(c) increase the maximum number of weeks in respect of
which a Canada recovery caregiving benefit is payable to a
person from 42 to 44.
It also makes a related amendment to the Canada Recovery Ben-
efits Regulations.

Part 3.1 provides for the completion of a performance audit and
tabling of a report by the Auditor General of Canada in respect of
certain benefits.
Part 4 amends the Canada Labour Code to, among other things,
create a regime that provides for a leave of absence related to
COVID-19 under which an employee may take
(a) up to six weeks if they are unable to work because,
among other things, they have contracted COVID-19, have
underlying conditions that in the opinion of certain persons
or entities would make them more susceptible to COVID-19 or
have isolated themselves on the advice of certain persons or
entities for reasons related to COVID-19; and
(b) up to 44 weeks if they are unable to work because, for
certain reasons related to COVID-19, they must care for a
child who is under the age of 12 or a family member who re-
quires supervised care.
It also makes a related amendment to the Budget Implementa-
tion Act, 2021, No. 1.
